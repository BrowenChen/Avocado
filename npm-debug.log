Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\nincluded in its place.\n\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\n\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\n\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\n  to send an authenticated request), and\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\n\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\n\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\nand the server.\n\n\n## Replay Protection\n\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\nkey identifier combination. \n\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\n\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\nto a bad timestamp.\n\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\n\n\n## Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\n        user: \'Steve\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    // Authenticate incoming request\n\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\n\n        // Prepare response\n\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\n\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\n\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\n\n        // Send the response back\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\n        res.end(payload);\n    });\n};\n\n// Start server\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nClient code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Request options\n\nvar requestOptions = {\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {}\n};\n\n// Generate Authorization request header\n\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\n\n// Send authenticated request\n\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\n\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\n\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\n\n    // Output results\n\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\n});\n```\n\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\n\n```javascript\nHawk.sntp.start();\n```\n\n\n## Protocol Example\n\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\nthe resource server:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\n```\n\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\n```\n\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\n\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\n* Algorithm: sha256\n\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\ncharacter):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nGET\n/resource/1?b=1&a=2\nexample.com\n8000\n\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\n\n```\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\n```\n\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\n```\n\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\n\n\n### Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\n* `hawk.1.payload`\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\n\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.payload\ntext/plain\nThank you for flying Hawk\n\n```\n\nWhich produces the following hash value:\n\n```\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\n```\n\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nPOST\n/resource/1?a=1&b=2\nexample.com\n8000\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nPOST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\n```\n\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\nand the nature of the data included.\n\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\n\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\n\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\n\n\n## Response Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\n\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\n\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\n\n```\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\n\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\n\n\n# Single URI Authorization\n\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\n\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\n\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\nthe granted access timeframe. \n\n\n## Bewit Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\n    });\n};\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nBewit code generation:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Generate bewit\n\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\n```\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\n\n### MAC Keys Transmission\n\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\n\n### Confidentiality of Requests\n\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\nto protect sensitive resources.\n\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\n\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\n\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\n\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\n\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\n\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\naccess.\n\n### Entropy of Keys\n\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\ncredentials are valid.\n\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\nlongest key reasonable.\n\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\n\n### Coverage Limitations\n\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\n\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\n\n### Future Time Manipulation\n\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\n\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\n\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\n\n### Client Clock Poisoning\n\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\nthat particular server.\n\n### Bewit Limitations\n\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\nand sensitive information.\n\n### Host Header Forgery\n\nHawk validates the incoming request MAC against the incoming HTTP Host header. However, unless the optional `host` and `port`\noptions are used with `server.authenticate()`, a malicous client can mint new host names pointing to the server\'s IP address and\nuse that to craft an attack by sending a valid request that\'s meant for another hostname than the one used by the server. Server\nimplementors must manually verify that the host header received matches their expectation (or use the options mentioned above).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Where is the protocol specification?\n\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\nsomething? Open an issue!\n\n### Is it done?\n\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\nand suggestions.\n\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\n\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, it has been ported to other languages.\nThe full list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port&state=closed). Please add an issue if you are\nworking on another port. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\n\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\n\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\n\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\n\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\n\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\n\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\n\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\n\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\n\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\n\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\n\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\n\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\n\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\n\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\nat work to produce more garbage.\n\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\n\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\n',

Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!\n\nThe original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(\'hi\')                     // bl will also accept & convert Strings\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer([ 0x3, 0x4 ]))\n\nconsole.log(bl.length) // 12\n\nconsole.log(bl.slice(0, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'abcdefghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'defghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 6).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'def\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 8).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(5, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'fghij\'\n\n// or just use toString!\nconsole.log(bl.toString())               // \'abcdefghij\\u0003\\u0004\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 3, 8))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 5, 10)) // \'fghij\'\n\n// other standard Buffer readables\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16BE(10)) // 0x0304\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16LE(10)) // 0x0403\n```\n\nGive it a callback in the constructor and use it just like **[concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)**:\n\n```js\nconst bl = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs = require(\'fs\')\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'README.md\')\n  .pipe(bl(function (err, data) { // note \'new\' isn\'t strictly required\n    // `data` is a complete Buffer object containing the full data\n    console.log(data.toString())\n  }))\n```\n\nNote that when you use the *callback* method like this, the resulting `data` parameter is a concatenation of all `Buffer` objects in the list. If you want to avoid the overhead of this concatenation (in cases of extreme performance consciousness), then avoid the *callback* method and just listen to `\'end\'` instead, like a standard Stream.\n\nOr to fetch a URL using [hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest) (should work with [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) and even plain Node http too!):\n```js\nconst hyperquest = require(\'hyperquest\')\n    , bl         = require(\'bl\')\n    , url        = \'https://raw.github.com/rvagg/bl/master/README.md\'\n\nhyperquest(url).pipe(bl(function (err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString())\n}))\n```\n\nOr, use it as a readable stream to recompose a list of Buffers to an output source:\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs         = require(\'fs\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'hi\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\n\nbl.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'gibberish.txt\'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n  * <a href="#ctor"><code><b>new BufferList([ callback ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#length"><code>bl.<b>length</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#append"><code>bl.<b>append(buffer)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#get"><code>bl.<b>get(index)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#slice"><code>bl.<b>slice([ start[, end ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#copy"><code>bl.<b>copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#duplicate"><code>bl.<b>duplicate()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#consume"><code>bl.<b>consume(bytes)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#toString"><code>bl.<b>toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#readXX"><code>bl.<b>readDoubleBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readDoubleLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt8()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt8()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#streams">Streams</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="ctor"></a>\n### new BufferList([ callback | buffer | buffer array ])\nThe constructor takes an optional callback, if supplied, the callback will be called with an error argument followed by a reference to the **bl** instance, when `bl.end()` is called (i.e. from a piped stream). This is a convenient method of collecting the entire contents of a stream, particularly when the stream is *chunky*, such as a network stream.\n\nNormally, no arguments are required for the constructor, but you can initialise the list by passing in a single `Buffer` object or an array of `Buffer` object.\n\n`new` is not strictly required, if you don\'t instantiate a new object, it will be done automatically for you so you can create a new instance simply with:\n\n```js\nvar bl = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = bl()\n\n// equivilant to:\n\nvar BufferList = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = new BufferList()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="length"></a>\n### bl.length\nGet the length of the list in bytes. This is the sum of the lengths of all of the buffers contained in the list, minus any initial offset for a semi-consumed buffer at the beginning. Should accurately represent the total number of bytes that can be read from the list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="append"></a>\n### bl.append(buffer)\n`append(buffer)` adds an additional buffer or BufferList to the internal list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="get"></a>\n### bl.get(index)\n`get()` will return the byte at the specified index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="slice"></a>\n### bl.slice([ start, [ end ] ])\n`slice()` returns a new `Buffer` object containing the bytes within the range specified. Both `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\nIf the requested range spans a single internal buffer then a slice of that buffer will be returned which shares the original memory range of that Buffer. If the range spans multiple buffers then copy operations will likely occur to give you a uniform Buffer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="copy"></a>\n### bl.copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])\n`copy()` copies the content of the list in the `dest` buffer, starting from `destStart` and containing the bytes within the range specified with `srcStart` to `srcEnd`. `destStart`, `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning of the `dest` buffer, and the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="duplicate"></a>\n### bl.duplicate()\n`duplicate()` performs a **shallow-copy** of the list. The internal Buffers remains the same, so if you change the underlying Buffers, the change will be reflected in both the original and the duplicate. This method is needed if you want to call `consume()` or `pipe()` and still keep the original list.Example:\n\n```js\nvar bl = new BufferList()\n\nbl.append(\'hello\')\nbl.append(\' world\')\nbl.append(\'\\n\')\n\nbl.duplicate().pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })\n\nconsole.log(bl.toString())\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="consume"></a>\n### bl.consume(bytes)\n`consume()` will shift bytes *off the start of the list*. The number of bytes consumed don\'t need to line up with the sizes of the internal Buffers&mdash;initial offsets will be calculated accordingly in order to give you a consistent view of the data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="toString"></a>\n### bl.toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])\n`toString()` will return a string representation of the buffer. The optional `start` and `end` arguments are passed on to `slice()`, while the `encoding` is passed on to `toString()` of the resulting Buffer. See the [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end) documentation for more information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="readXX"></a>\n### <code>bl.readDoubleBE()</code>, <code>bl.readDoubleLE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatBE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatLE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt8()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt8()</code>\n\nAll of the standard byte-reading methods of the `Buffer` interface are implemented and will operate across internal Buffer boundaries transparently.\n\nSee the <b><code>[Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html)</code></b> documentation for how these work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="streams"></a>\n### Streams\n**bl** is a Node **[Duplex Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)**, so it can be read from and written to like a standard Node stream.

It allows you to get/set/check for headers in a caseless manor while also preserving the caseing of headers the first time they are set.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'asdf\')\nc.get(\'a-header\') === \'asdf\'\n```\n\n## has(key)\n\nHas takes a name and if it finds a matching header will return that header name with the preserved caseing it was set with.\n\n```javascript\nc.has(\'a-header\') === \'a-Header\'\n```\n\n## set(key, value[, clobber=true])\n\nSet is fairly straight forward except that if the header exists and clobber is disabled it will add `\',\'+value` to the existing header.\n\n```javascript\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'fdas\')\nc.set(\'a-HEADER\', \'more\', false)\nc.get(\'a-header\') === \'fdsa,more\'\n```\n\n## swap(key)\n\nSwaps the casing of a header with the new one that is passed in.\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'fdas\')\nc.swap(\'a-HEADER\')\nc.has(\'a-header\') === \'a-HEADER\'\nheaders === {\'a-HEADER\': \'fdas\'}\n```\n',

Feel free to add more!\n- Browser support via Browserify and Component by converting lists to JSON files.\n\nOtherwise, the API is compatible.\n\n### Adding Types\n\nIf you\'d like to add additional types,\nsimply create a PR adding the type to `custom.json` and\na reference link to the [sources](SOURCES.md).\n\nDo __NOT__ edit `mime.json` or `node.json`.\nThose are pulled using `build.js`.\nYou should only touch `custom.json`.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar mime = require(\'mime-types\')\n```\n\nAll functions return `false` if input is invalid or not found.\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\n\nLookup the content-type associated with a file.\n\n```js\nmime.lookup(\'json\')           // \'application/json\'\nmime.lookup(\'.md\')            // \'text/x-markdown\'\nmime.lookup(\'file.html\')      // \'text/html\'\nmime.lookup(\'folder/file.js\') // \'application/javascript\'\n\nmime.lookup(\'cats\') // false\n```\n\n### mime.contentType(type)\n\nCreate a full content-type header given a content-type or extension.\n\n```js\nmime.contentType(\'markdown\')  // \'text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8\'\nmime.contentType(\'file.json\') // \'application/json; charset=utf-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.extension(type)\n\nGet the default extension for a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\') // \'bin\'\n```\n\n### mime.charset(type)\n\nLookup the implied default charset of a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.charset(\'text/x-markdown\') // \'UTF-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.types[extension] = type\n\nA map of content-types by extension.\n\n### mime.extensions[type] = [extensions]\n\nA map of extensions by content-type.\n\n### mime.define(types)\n\nGlobally add definitions.\n`types` must be an object of the form:\n\n```js\n{\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...],\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...]\n}\n```\n\nSee the `.json` files in `lib/` for examples.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n',

See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified.

Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.

(i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\n> cd test\n> node test.js\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

32077 silly resolved     readme: '# qs\n\nA querystring parsing and stringifying library with some added security.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs)\n\nLead Maintainer: [Nathan LaFreniere](https://github.com/nlf)\n\nThe **qs** module was originally created and maintained by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring).\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Qs = require(\'qs\');\n\nvar obj = Qs.parse(\'a=c\');    // { a: \'c\' }\nvar str = Qs.stringify(obj);  // \'a=c\'\n```\n\n### Parsing Objects\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(string, [depth], [delimiter]);\n```\n\n**qs** allows you to create nested objects within your query strings, by surrounding the name of sub-keys with square brackets `[]`.\nFor example, the string `\'foo[bar]=baz\'` converts to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: \'baz\'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nURI encoded strings work too:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a%5Bb%5D=c\');\n// { a: { b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also nest your objects, like `\'foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz\'`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: {\n      baz: \'foobarbaz\'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, when nesting objects **qs** will only parse up to 5 children deep. This means if you attempt to parse a string like\n`\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\'` your resulting object will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  a: {\n    b: {\n      c: {\n        d: {\n          e: {\n            f: {\n              \'[g][h][i]\': \'j\'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `Qs.parse(string, depth)`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\', 1);\n// { a: { b: { \'[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]\': \'j\' } } }\n```\n\nThe depth limit mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number.\n\nAn optional delimiter can also be passed:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d\', \';\');\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }\n```\n\n### Parsing Arrays\n\n**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=b&a[]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nYou may specify an index as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=c&a[0]=b\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number\nto create an array. When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving\ntheir order:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b&a[15]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=&a[]=b\');\n// { a: [\'\', \'b\'] }\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[1]=&a[2]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\n**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`. Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will\ninstead be converted to an object with the index as the key:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[100]=b\');\n// { a: { \'100\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nIf you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[b]=c\');\n// { a: { \'0\': \'b\', b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also create arrays of objects:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[][b]=c\');\n// { a: [{ b: \'c\' }] }\n```\n\n### Stringifying\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify(object, [delimiter]);\n```\n\nWhen stringifying, **qs** always URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\' });\n// \'a=b\'\nQs.stringify({ a: { b: \'c\' } });\n// \'a%5Bb%5D=c\'\n```\n\nExamples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity. Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.\n\nWhen arrays are stringified, they are always given explicit indices:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] });\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c&a[2]=d\'\n```\n\nEmpty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'\' });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nProperties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nThe delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }, \';\');\n// \'a=b;c=d\'\n```\n',

32077 silly resolved     readme: '[RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js\n\n![Tough Cookie](http://www.goinstant.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tough-cookie.jpg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie)\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/tough-cookie)\n![NPM Downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/tough-cookie.png?months=9)\n\n# Synopsis\n\n``` javascript\nvar tough = require(\'tough-cookie\'); // note: not \'cookie\', \'cookies\' or \'node-cookie\'\nvar Cookie = tough.Cookie;\nvar cookie = Cookie.parse(header);\ncookie.value = \'somethingdifferent\';\nheader = cookie.toString();\n\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();\ncookiejar.setCookie(cookie, \'http://currentdomain.example.com/path\', cb);\n// ...\ncookiejar.getCookies(\'http://example.com/otherpath\',function(err,cookies) {\n  res.headers[\'cookie\'] = cookies.join(\'; \');\n});\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nIt\'s _so_ easy!\n\n`npm install tough-cookie`\n\nRequires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the [XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n[streams2-thing]: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_versions\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, call ```submit(url, [callback])``` method:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'http://example.org/\', function(err, res) {\n  // res – response object (http.IncomingMessage)  //\n  res.resume(); // for node-0.10.x\n});\n\n```\n\nFor more advanced request manipulations ```submit()``` method returns ```http.ClientRequest``` object, or you can choose from one of the alternative submission methods.\n\n### Alternative submission methods\n\nYou can use node\'s http client interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (```fs.readStream```, ```http.response``` and ```mikeal\'s request```), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nIn case you need to also send custom HTTP headers with the POST request, you can use the `headers` key in first parameter of `form.submit()`:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/surelynot.php\',\n  headers: {\'x-test-header\': \'test-header-value\'}\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- ```getLengthSync()``` method DOESN\'T calculate length for streams, use ```knownLength``` options as workaround.\n- If it feels like FormData hangs after submit and you\'re on ```node-0.10```, please check [Compatibility with Older Node Versions][streams2-thing]\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

List of build-in methods can be found\nfor example from [Dive Into JavaScript][d].\n\n[d]: http://www.diveintojavascript.com/core-javascript-reference/the-string-object\n\n\nAs name states this an extension for [Underscore.js][u], but it can be used\nindependently from **_s**-global variable. But with Underscore.js you can\nuse Object-Oriented style and chaining:\n\n[u]: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/\n\n```javascript\n_("   epeli  ").chain().trim().capitalize().value()\n=> "Epeli"\n```\n\n## Download ##\n\n  * [Development version](https://raw.github.com/epeli/underscore.string/master/lib/underscore.string.js) *Uncompressed with Comments 18kb*\n  * [Production version](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/raw/master/dist/underscore.string.min.js) *Minified 7kb*\n\n\n## Node.js installation ##\n\n**npm package**\n\n    npm install underscore.string\n\n**Standalone usage**:\n\n```javascript\nvar _s = require(\'underscore.string\');\n```\n\n**Integrate with Underscore.js**:\n\n```javascript\nvar _  = require(\'underscore\');\n\n// Import Underscore.string to separate object, because there are conflict functions (include, reverse, contains)\n_.str = require(\'underscore.string\');\n\n// Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace if you want\n_.mixin(_.str.exports());\n\n// All functions, include conflict, will be available through _.str object\n_.str.include(\'Underscore.string\', \'string\'); // => true\n```\n\n**Or Integrate with Underscore.js without module loading**\n\nRun the following expression after Underscore.js and Underscore.string are loaded\n```javascript\n// _.str becomes a global variable if no module loading is detected\n// Mix in non-conflict functions to Underscore namespace\n_.mixin(_.str.exports());\n```\n\n## String Functions ##\n\nFor availability of functions in this way you need to mix in Underscore.string functions:\n\n```javascript\n_.mixin(_.string.exports());\n```\n\notherwise functions from examples will be available through _.string or _.str objects:\n\n```javascript\n_.str.capitalize(\'epeli\')\n=> "Epeli"\n```\n\n**numberFormat** _.numberFormat(number, [ decimals=0, decimalSeparator=\'.\', orderSeparator=\',\'])\n\nFormats the numbers.\n\n```javascript\n_.numberFormat(1000, 2)\n=> "1,000.00"\n\n_.numberFormat(123456789.123, 5, \'.\', \',\')\n=> "123,456,789.12300"\n```\n\n\n**levenshtein** _.levenshtein(string1, string2)\n\nCalculates [Levenshtein distance][ld] between two strings.\n[ld]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance\n\n```javascript\n_.levenshtein(\'kitten\', \'kittah\')\n=> 2\n```\n\n**capitalize** _.capitalize(string)\n\nConverts first letter of the string to uppercase.\n\n```javascript\n_.capitalize("foo Bar")\n=> "Foo Bar"\n```\n\n**chop** _.chop(string, step)\n\n```javascript\n_.chop(\'whitespace\', 3)\n=> [\'whi\',\'tes\',\'pac\',\'e\']\n```\n\n**clean** _.clean(str)\n\nCompress some whitespaces to one.\n\n```javascript\n_.clean(" foo    bar   ")\n=> \'foo bar\'\n```\n\n**chars** _.chars(str)\n\n```javascript\n_.chars(\'Hello\')\n=> [\'H\',\'e\',\'l\',\'l\',\'o\']\n```\n\n**swapCase** _.swapCase(str)\n\nReturns a copy of the string in which all the case-based characters have had their case swapped.\n\n```javascript\n_.swapCase(\'hELLO\')\n=> \'Hello\'\n```\n\n**include** available only through _.str object, because Underscore has function with the same name.\n\n```javascript\n_.str.include("foobar", "ob")\n=> true\n```\n\n(removed) **includes** _.includes(string, substring)\n\nTests if string contains a substring.\n\n```javascript\n_.includes("foobar", "ob")\n=> true\n```\n\n**includes** function was removed\n\nBut you can create it in this way, for compatibility with previous versions:\n\n```javascript\n_.includes = _.str.include\n```\n\n**count** _.count(string, substring)\n\n```javascript\n_(\'Hello world\').count(\'l\')\n=> 3\n```\n\n**escapeHTML** _.escapeHTML(string)\n\nConverts HTML special characters to their entity equivalents.\n\n```javascript\n_(\'<div>Blah blah blah</div>\').escapeHTML();\n=> \'&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;\'\n```\n\n**unescapeHTML** _.unescapeHTML(string)\n\nConverts entity characters to HTML equivalents.\n\n```javascript\n_(\'&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/div&gt;\').unescapeHTML();\n=> \'<div>Blah blah blah</div>\'\n```\n\n**insert** _.insert(string, index, substing)\n\n```javascript\n_(\'Hello \').insert(6, \'world\')\n=> \'Hello world\'\n```\n\n**isBlank** _.isBlank(string)\n\n```javascript\n_(\'\').isBlank();

Just email me or more preferably open an issue.\n\n#### Problems\n\nWe lose two things for `include` and `reverse` methods from `_.string`:\n\n* Calls like `_(\'foobar\').include(\'bar\')` aren\'t available;\n* Chaining isn\'t available too.\n\nBut if you need this functionality you can create aliases for conflict functions which will be convenient for you:\n\n```javascript\n_.mixin({\n    includeString: _.str.include,\n    reverseString: _.str.reverse\n})\n\n// Now wrapper calls and chaining are available.\n_(\'foobar\').chain().reverseString().includeString(\'rab\').value()\n```\n\n#### Standalone Usage\n\nIf you are using Underscore.string without Underscore. You also have `_.string` namespace for it and `_.str` alias\nBut of course you can just reassign `_` variable with `_.string`\n\n```javascript\n_ = _.string\n```\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n### 2.3.3 ###\n\n* Add `toBoolean`\n* Add `unquote`\n* Add quote char option to `quote`\n* Support dash-separated words in `titleize`\n\n### 2.3.2 ###\n\n* Add `naturalCmp`\n* Bug fix to `camelize`\n* Add ă, ș, ț and ś to `slugify`\n* Doc updates\n* Add support for [component](http://component.io/)\n* [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2)\n\n### 2.3.1 ###\n\n* Bug fixes to `escapeHTML`, `classify`, `substr`\n* Faster `count`\n* Documentation fixes\n* [Full changelog](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1)\n\n### 2.3.0 ###\n\n* Added `numberformat` method\n* Added `levenshtein` method (Levenshtein distance calculation)\n* Added `swapCase` method\n* Changed default behavior of `words` method\n* Added `toSentenceSerial` method\n* Added `surround` and `quote` methods\n\n### 2.2.1 ###\n\n* Same as 2.2.0 (2.2.0rc on npm) to fix some npm drama\n\n### 2.2.0 ###\n\n* Capitalize method behavior changed\n* Various perfomance tweaks\n\n### 2.1.1###\n\n* Fixed words method bug\n* Added classify method\n\n### 2.1.0 ###\n\n* AMD support\n* Added toSentence method\n* Added slugify method\n* Lots of speed optimizations\n\n### 2.0.0 ###\n\n* Added prune, humanize functions\n* Added _.string (_.str) namespace for Underscore.string library\n* Removed includes function\n\nFor upgrading to this version you need to mix in Underscore.string library to Underscore object:\n\n```javascript\n_.mixin(_.string.exports());\n```\n\nand all non-conflict Underscore.string functions will be available through Underscore object.\nAlso function `includes` has been removed, you should replace this function by `_.str.include`\nor create alias `_.includes = _.str.include` and all your code will work fine.\n\n### 1.1.6 ###\n\n* Fixed reverse and truncate\n* Added isBlank, stripTags, inlude(alias for includes)\n* Added uglifier compression\n\n### 1.1.5 ###\n\n* Added strRight, strRightBack, strLeft, strLeftBack\n\n### 1.1.4 ###\n\n* Added pad, lpad, rpad, lrpad methods and aliases center, ljust, rjust\n* Integration with Underscore 1.1.6\n\n### 1.1.3 ###\n\n* Added methods: underscored, camelize, dasherize\n* Support newer version of npm\n\n### 1.1.2 ###\n\n* Created functions: lines, chars, words functions\n\n### 1.0.2 ###\n\n* Created integration test suite with underscore.js 1.1.4 (now it\'s absolutely compatible)\n* Removed \'reverse\' function, because this function override underscore.js \'reverse\'\n\n## Contribute ##\n\n* Fork & pull request. Don\'t forget about tests.\n* If you planning add some feature please create issue before.\n\nOtherwise changes will be rejected.\n\n## Contributors list ##\n[Can be found here](https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string/graphs/contributors).\n\n\n## Licence ##\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Esa-Matti Suuronen esa-matti@suuronen.org\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

32453 silly resolved     readme: 'Like FS streams, but with stat on them, and supporting directories and\nsymbolic links, as well as normal files.  Also, you can use this to set\nthe stats on a file, even if you don\'t change its contents, or to create\na symlink, etc.\n\nSo, for example, you can "write" a directory, and it\'ll call `mkdir`.  You\ncan specify a uid and gid, and it\'ll call `chown`.  You can specify a\n`mtime` and `atime`, and it\'ll call `utimes`.  You can call it a symlink\nand provide a `linkpath` and it\'ll call `symlink`.\n\nNote that it won\'t automatically resolve symbolic links.  So, if you\ncall `fstream.Reader(\'/some/symlink\')` then you\'ll get an object\nthat stats and then ends immediately (since it has no data).  To follow\nsymbolic links, do this: `fstream.Reader({path:\'/some/symlink\', follow:\ntrue })`.\n\nThere are various checks to make sure that the bytes emitted are the\nsame as the intended size, if the size is set.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nThis will create the directories if they\'re missing, and then write\n`hello\\n` into the file, chmod it to 0755, and assert that 6 bytes have\nbeen written when it\'s done.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          , flags: "a"\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nYou can pass flags in, if you want to append to a file.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/symlink"\n          , linkpath: "./file"\n          , SymbolicLink: true\n          , mode: "0755" // octal strings supported\n          })\n  .end()\n```\n\nIf isSymbolicLink is a function, it\'ll be called, and if it returns\ntrue, then it\'ll treat it as a symlink.  If it\'s not a function, then\nany truish value will make a symlink, or you can set `type:\n\'SymbolicLink\'`, which does the same thing.\n\nNote that the linkpath is relative to the symbolic link location, not\nthe parent dir or cwd.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Reader("path/to/dir")\n  .pipe(fstream.Writer("path/to/other/dir"))\n```\n\nThis will do like `cp -Rp path/to/dir path/to/other/dir`.  If the other\ndir exists and isn\'t a directory, then it\'ll emit an error.  It\'ll also\nset the uid, gid, mode, etc. to be identical.  In this way, it\'s more\nlike `rsync -a` than simply a copy.\n',

32843 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the `callback` should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Examples__\n\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names \n\nasync.each(openFiles, function( file, callback) {\n  \n  // Perform operation on file here.\n  console.log(\'Processing file \' + file);\n  \n  if( file.length > 32 ) {\n    console.log(\'This file name is too long\');\n    callback(\'File name too long\');\n  } else {\n    // Do work to process file here\n    console.log(\'File processed\');\n    callback();\n  }\n}, function(err){\n    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error\n    if( err ) {\n      // One of the iterations produced an error.\n      // All processing will now stop.\n      console.log(\'A file failed to process\');\n    } else {\n      console.log(\'All files have been processed successfully\');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThis means the `iterator` functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items in `arr` are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through\nthe `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: \nan `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to this \ncallback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. \nHowever, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapLimit" />\n### mapLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  calls have finished, or an error occurs. The result is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="select" />\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `select`\n\nReturns a new array of all the values in `arr` which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The `iterator` is passed a `callback(truthValue)`, which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="selectSeries" />\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `selectSeries`\n\nThe same as [`filter`](#filter) only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of [`filter`](#filter). Removes values that pass an `async` truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`reject`](#reject), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Aliases:__ `inject`, `foldl`\n\nReduces `arr` into a single value using an async `iterator` to return\neach successive step. `memo` is the initial state of the reduction. \nThis function only operates in series. \n\nFor performance reasons, it may make sense to split a call to this function into \na parallel map, and then use the normal `Array.prototype.reduce` on the results. \nThis function is for situations where each step in the reduction needs to be async; \nif you can get the data before reducing it, then it\'s probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `memo` - The initial state of the reduction.\n* `iterator(memo, item, callback)` - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The `iterator` is passed a\n  `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* `callback(err, result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `foldr`\n\nSame as [`reduce`](#reduce), only operates on `arr` in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in `arr` that passes an async truth test. The\n`iterator` is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return `true` will\nfire the detect `callback` with that result.

If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number.

This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

32843 silly resolved     readme: '# combined-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream)\n\nA stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install combined-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine\ntwo files into one:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nWhile the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until\nthey are needed. If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project, plus additional types submitted by the node.js community.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install mime\n\n## API - Queries\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\nGet the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `path` (the substring after the last \'/\' or \'.\').  E.g.\n\n    var mime = require(\'mime\');\n\n    mime.lookup(\'/path/to/file.txt\');         // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'file.txt\');                  // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'.TXT\');                      // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'htm\');                       // => \'text/html\'\n\n### mime.default_type\nSets the mime type returned when `mime.lookup` fails to find the extension searched for. (Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

Its name comes from the C header file.\n\nTo get started, simply clone the repository or use npm to install it. Once it is\nthere, simply require it.\n\ngit clone git://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype\nnpm install ctype\nvar mod_ctype = require(\'ctype\')\n\n\nThere are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction you\'d like.\nThe low level API let\'s you read and write individual integers and floats from\nbuffers. The higher level API let\'s you read and write structures of these. To\nillustrate this, let\'s looks look at how we would read and write a binary\nencoded x,y point.\n\nIn C we would define this structure as follows:\n\ntypedef struct point {\n\tuint16_t\tp_x;\n\tuint16_t\tp_y;\n} point_t;\n\nTo read a binary encoded point from a Buffer, we first need to create a CType\nparser (where we specify the endian and other options) and add the typedef.\n\nvar parser = new mod_ctype.Parser({ endian: \'big\' });\nparser.typedef(\'point_t\', [\n\t{ x: { type: \'uint16_t\' } },\n\t{ y: { type: \'uint16_t\' } }\n]);\n\nFrom here, given a buffer buf and an offset into it, we can read a point.\n\nvar out = parser.readData([ { point: { type: \'point_t\' } } ], buffer, 0);\nconsole.log(out);\n{ point: { x: 23, y: 42 } }\n\nAnother way to get the same information would be to use the low level methods.\nNote that these require you to manually deal with the offset. Here\'s how we\'d\nget the same values of x and y from the buffer.\n\nvar x = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 0);\nvar y = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 2);\nconsole.log(x + \', \' + y);\n23, 42\n\nThe true power of this API comes from the ability to define and nest typedefs,\njust as you would in C. By default, the following types are defined by default.\nNote that they return a Number, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n    * int8_t\n    * int16_t\n    * int32_t\n    * int64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * uint8_t\n    * uint16_t\n    * uint32_t\n    * uint64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * float\n    * double\n    * char (either returns a buffer with that character or a uint8_t)\n    * char[] (returns an object with the buffer and the number of characters read which is either the total amount requested or until the first 0)\n\n\nctf2json integration:\n\nNode-CType supports consuming the output of ctf2json. Once you read in a JSON file,\nall you have to do to add all the definitions it contains is:\n\nvar data, parser;\ndata = JSON.parse(parsedJSONData);\nparser = mod_ctype.parseCTF(data, { endian: \'big\' });\n\nFor more documentation, see the file README.old. Full documentation is in the\nprocess of being rewritten as a series of manual pages which will be available\nin the repository and online for viewing.\n\nTo read the ctio manual page simple run, from the root of the workspace:\n\nman -Mman -s 3ctype ctio\n',

Like\n`assert.string(myArg, \'myArg\')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require(\'assert-plus\');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, \'options\');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, \'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, \'options.isManager\');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, \'options.name\');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, \'options.email\');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, \'callback\');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren\'t* part of node\'s core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string \'name\' that\'s not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, \'foo\');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don\'t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

33280 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.\n\n```js\n// decode domain names\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn--maana-pta.com\');\n// → \'mañana.com\'\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn----dqo34k.com\');\n// → \'☃-⌘.com\'\n\n// decode email addresses\npunycode.toUnicode(\'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\');\n// → \'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toASCII(input)`\n\nConverts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that\'s already in ASCII.\n\n```js\n// encode domain names\npunycode.toASCII(\'mañana.com\');\n// → \'xn--maana-pta.com\'\npunycode.toASCII(\'☃-⌘.com\');\n// → \'xn----dqo34k.com\'\n\n// encode email addresses\npunycode.toASCII(\'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\');\n// → \'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.ucs2`\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`\n\nCreates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'abc\');\n// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]\n// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'\\uD834\\uDF06\');\n// → [0x1D306]\n```\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`\n\nCreates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);\n// → \'abc\'\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);\n// → \'\\uD834\\uDF06\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.version`\n\nA string representing the current Punycode.js version number.\n\n## Unit tests & code coverage\n\nAfter cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.\n\nOnce that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.\n\nTo generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n## Author\n\n| [![twitter/mathias](https://gravatar.com/avatar/24e08a9ea84deb17ae121074d0f17125?s=70)](https://twitter.com/mathias "Follow @mathias on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/) |\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [![twitter/jdalton](https://gravatar.com/avatar/299a3d891ff1920b69c364d061007043?s=70)](https://twitter.com/jdalton "Follow @jdalton on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) |\n\n## License\n\nPunycode.js is available under the [MIT](http://mths.be/mit) license.\n',

34111 silly resolved     readme: '# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](http://api.nodejs.org/fs.html)\n\ngraceful-fs:\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n',

If `opts` is a non-object, it will be treated as\nthe `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\n`cb(err, made)` fires with the error or the first directory `made`\nthat had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdir(path, mode, cb)` and\n`opts.fs.stat(path, cb)`.\n\n## mkdirp.sync(dir, opts)\n\nSynchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir`\nwith octal permission string `opts.mode`. If `opts` is a non-object, it will be\ntreated as the `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\nReturns the first directory that had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdirSync(path, mode)` and\n`opts.fs.statSync(path)`.\n\n# usage\n\nThis package also ships with a `mkdirp` command.\n\n```\nusage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] {OPTIONS}\n\n  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that\n  don\'t yet exist.\n  \n  If the directory already exists, do nothing.\n\nOPTIONS are:\n\n  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal\n               permission string.\n\n```\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the library, or\n\n```\nnpm install -g mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the command.\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

34425 silly resolved     readme: '# sntp\n\nAn SNTP v4 client (RFC4330) for node. Simpy connects to the NTP or SNTP server requested and returns the server time\nalong with the roundtrip duration and clock offset. To adjust the local time to the NTP time, add the returned `t` offset\nto the local time.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Sntp = require(\'sntp\');\n\n// All options are optional\n\nvar options = {\n    host: \'nist1-sj.ustiming.org\',  // Defaults to pool.ntp.org\n    port: 123,                      // Defaults to 123 (NTP)\n    resolveReference: true,         // Default to false (not resolving)\n    timeout: 1000                   // Defaults to zero (no timeout)\n};\n\n// Request server time\n\nSntp.time(options, function (err, time) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.log(\'Failed: \' + err.message);\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    console.log(\'Local clock is off by: \' + time.t + \' milliseconds\');\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\nIf an application needs to maintain continuous time synchronization, the module provides a stateful method for\nquerying the current offset only when the last one is too old (defaults to daily).\n\n```javascript\n// Request offset once\n\nSntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n    console.log(offset);                    // New (served fresh)\n\n    // Request offset again\n\n    Sntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n        console.log(offset);                // Identical (served from cache)\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo set a background offset refresh, start the interval and use the provided now() method. If for any reason the\nclient fails to obtain an up-to-date offset, the current system clock is used.\n\n```javascript\nvar before = Sntp.now();                    // System time without offset\n\nSntp.start(function () {\n\n    var now = Sntp.now();                   // With offset\n    Sntp.stop();\n});\n```\n\n',

It comes with useful methods for Arrays (clone, merge, applyToDefaults), Objects (removeKeys, copy), Asserting and more. \r\n\r\nFor example, to use Hoek to set configuration with default options:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Hoek = require(\'hoek\');\r\n\r\nvar default = {url : "www.github.com", port : "8000", debug : true}\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(default, {port : "3000", admin : true});\r\n\r\n// In this case, config would be { url: \'www.github.com\', port: \'3000\', debug: true, admin: true }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder each of the sections (such as Array), there are subsections which correspond to Hoek methods. Each subsection will explain how to use the corresponding method. In each js excerpt below, the var Hoek = require(\'hoek\') is omitted for brevity.\r\n\r\n## Object\r\n\r\nHoek provides several helpful methods for objects and arrays.\r\n\r\n### clone(obj)\r\n\r\nThis method is used to clone an object or an array. A *deep copy* is made (duplicates everything, including values that are objects). \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar nestedObj = {\r\n        w: /^something$/ig,\r\n        x: {\r\n            a: [1, 2, 3],\r\n            b: 123456,\r\n            c: new Date()\r\n        },\r\n        y: \'y\',\r\n        z: new Date()\r\n    };\r\n\r\nvar copy = Hoek.clone(nestedObj);\r\n\r\ncopy.x.b = 100;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(copy.y)        // results in \'y\'\r\nconsole.log(nestedObj.x.b) // results in 123456\r\nconsole.log(copy.x.b)      // results in 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### merge(target, source, isNullOverride, isMergeArrays)\r\nisNullOverride, isMergeArrays default to true\r\n\r\nMerge all the properties of source into target, source wins in conflic, and by default null and undefined from source are applied\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar target = {a: 1, b : 2}\r\nvar source = {a: 0, c: 5}\r\nvar source2 = {a: null, c: 5}\r\n\r\nvar targetArray = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar sourceArray = [4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source);     // results in {a: 0, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2);        // results in {a: null, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2, false); // results in {a: 1, b: 2, c: 5}\r\n\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray)              // results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray, true, false) // results in [4, 5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### applyToDefaults(defaults, options)\r\n\r\nApply options to a copy of the defaults\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar defaults = {host: "localhost", port: 8000};\r\nvar options = {port: 8080};\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(defaults, options); // results in {host: "localhost", port: 8080};\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### unique(array, key)\r\n\r\nRemove duplicate items from Array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.unique(array); // results in [1,2,3,4,5,6];\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\n\r\nnewArray = Hoek.unique(array, "id") // results in [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### mapToObject(array, key)\r\n\r\nConvert an Array into an Object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1,2,3];\r\nvar newObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array); // results in [{"1": true}, {"2": true}, {"3": true}]\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\nnewObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array, "id") // results in [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n### intersect(array1, array2)\r\n\r\nFind the common unique items in two arrays\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array1 = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar array2 = [1, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.intersect(array1, array2) // results in [1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### matchKeys(obj, keys) \r\n\r\nFind which keys are present\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};\r\nvar keys = ["a", "e"];\r\n\r\nHoek.matchKeys(obj, keys) // returns ["a"]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### flatten(array, target)\r\n\r\nFlatten an array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar target = [4, 5]; \r\n\r\nvar flattenedArray = Hoek.flatten(array, target) // results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### removeKeys(object, keys)\r\n\r\nRemove keys\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};\r\n\r\nvar keys = ["a", "b"];\r\n\r\nHoek.removeKeys(object, keys) // object is now {c: 3, d: 4}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### reach(obj, chain)\r\n\r\nConverts an object key chain string to reference\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar chain = \'a.b.c\';\r\nvar obj = {a : {b : { c : 1}}};\r\n\r\nHoek.reach(obj, chain) // returns 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### inheritAsync(self, obj, keys) \r\n\r\nInherits a selected set of methods from an object, wrapping functions in asynchronous syntax and catching errors\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar targetFunc = function () { };\r\n\r\nvar proto = {\r\n                a: function () {\r\n                    return \'a!\';\r\n                },\r\n                b: function () {\r\n                    return \'b!\';\r\n                },\r\n                c: function () {\r\n                    throw new Error(\'c!\');\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n\r\nvar keys = [\'a\', \'c\'];\r\n\r\nHoek.inheritAsync(targetFunc, proto, [\'a\', \'c\']);\r\n\r\nvar target = new targetFunc();\r\n\r\ntarget.a(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns \'a!\'       \r\n\r\ntarget.c(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns undefined\r\n\r\ntarget.b(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // gives error: Object [object Object] has no method \'b\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### rename(obj, from, to)\r\n\r\nRename a key of an object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a : 1, b : 2};\r\n\r\nHoek.rename(obj, "a", "c");     // obj is now {c : 1, b : 2}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timer\r\n\r\nA Timer object. Initializing a new timer object sets the ts to the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nexample : \r\n\r\n\r\nvar timerObj = new Hoek.Timer();\r\nconsole.log("Time is now: " + timerObj.ts)\r\nconsole.log("Elapsed time from initialization: " + timerObj.elapsed() + \'milliseconds\')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Binary Encoding/Decoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlEncode(value)\r\n\r\nEncodes value in Base64 or URL encoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlDecode(value)\r\n\r\nDecodes data in Base64 or URL encoding.\r\n# Escaping Characters\r\n\r\nHoek provides convenient methods for escaping html characters. The escaped characters are as followed:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\ninternals.htmlEscaped = {\r\n    \'&\': \'&amp;\',\r\n    \'<\': \'&lt;\',\r\n    \'>\': \'&gt;\',\r\n    \'"\': \'&quot;\',\r\n    "\'": \'&#x27;\',\r\n    \'`\': \'&#x60;\'\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHtml(string)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar string = \'<html> hey </html>\';\r\nvar escapedString = Hoek.escapeHtml(string); // returns &lt;html&gt; hey &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHeaderAttribute(attribute)\r\n\r\nEscape attribute value for use in HTTP header\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeHeaderAttribute(\'I said "go w\\\\o me"\');  //returns I said \\"go w\\\\o me\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### escapeRegex(string)\r\n\r\nEscape string for Regex construction\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeRegex(\'4^f$s.4*5+-_?%=#!:@|~\\\\/`"(>)[<]d{}s,\');  // returns 4\\^f\\$s\\.4\\*5\\+\\-_\\?%\\=#\\!\\:@\\|~\\\\\\/`"\\(>\\)\\[<\\]d\\{\\}s\\,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Errors\r\n\r\n### assert(message)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = 1, b =2;\r\n\r\nHoek.assert(a === b, \'a should equal b\');  // ABORT: a should equal b\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### abort(message)\r\n\r\nFirst checks if process.env.NODE_ENV === \'test\', and if so, throws error message. Otherwise,\r\ndisplays most recent stack and then exits process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### displayStack(slice)\r\n\r\nDisplays the trace stack\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.displayStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack) // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ \'null (/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js:4:18)\',\r\n  \'Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\',\r\n  \'Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\',\r\n  \'Module.load (module.js:356:32)\',\r\n  \'Module._load (module.js:312:12)\',\r\n  \'Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)\',\r\n  \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)\' ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### callStack(slice)\r\n\r\nReturns a trace stack array.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.callStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack)  // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ [ \'/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js\', 4, 18, null, false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 449, 26, \'Module._compile\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 467, 10, \'Module._extensions..js\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 356, 32, \'Module.load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 312, 12, \'Module._load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 492, 10, \'Module.runMain\', false ],\r\n  [ \'node.js\',\r\n    244,\r\n    9,\r\n    \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback\',\r\n    false ] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### toss(condition)\r\n\r\ntoss(condition /*, [message], callback */)\r\n\r\nReturn an error as first argument of a callback\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load Files\r\n\r\n### loadPackage(dir)\r\n\r\nLoad and parse package.json process root or given directory\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar pack = Hoek.loadPackage();  // pack.name === \'hoek\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### loadDirModules(path, excludeFiles, target) \r\n\r\nLoads modules from a given path; option to exclude files (array).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

34776 silly resolved     readme: 'Like FS streams, but with stat on them, and supporting directories and\nsymbolic links, as well as normal files.  Also, you can use this to set\nthe stats on a file, even if you don\'t change its contents, or to create\na symlink, etc.\n\nSo, for example, you can "write" a directory, and it\'ll call `mkdir`.  You\ncan specify a uid and gid, and it\'ll call `chown`.  You can specify a\n`mtime` and `atime`, and it\'ll call `utimes`.  You can call it a symlink\nand provide a `linkpath` and it\'ll call `symlink`.\n\nNote that it won\'t automatically resolve symbolic links.  So, if you\ncall `fstream.Reader(\'/some/symlink\')` then you\'ll get an object\nthat stats and then ends immediately (since it has no data).  To follow\nsymbolic links, do this: `fstream.Reader({path:\'/some/symlink\', follow:\ntrue })`.\n\nThere are various checks to make sure that the bytes emitted are the\nsame as the intended size, if the size is set.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nThis will create the directories if they\'re missing, and then write\n`hello\\n` into the file, chmod it to 0755, and assert that 6 bytes have\nbeen written when it\'s done.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          , flags: "a"\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nYou can pass flags in, if you want to append to a file.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/symlink"\n          , linkpath: "./file"\n          , SymbolicLink: true\n          , mode: "0755" // octal strings supported\n          })\n  .end()\n```\n\nIf isSymbolicLink is a function, it\'ll be called, and if it returns\ntrue, then it\'ll treat it as a symlink.  If it\'s not a function, then\nany truish value will make a symlink, or you can set `type:\n\'SymbolicLink\'`, which does the same thing.\n\nNote that the linkpath is relative to the symbolic link location, not\nthe parent dir or cwd.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Reader("path/to/dir")\n  .pipe(fstream.Writer("path/to/other/dir"))\n```\n\nThis will do like `cp -Rp path/to/dir path/to/other/dir`.  If the other\ndir exists and isn\'t a directory, then it\'ll emit an error.  It\'ll also\nset the uid, gid, mode, etc. to be identical.  In this way, it\'s more\nlike `rsync -a` than simply a copy.\n',

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\nincluded in its place.\n\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\n\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\n\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\n  to send an authenticated request), and\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\n\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\n\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\nand the server.\n\n\n## Replay Protection\n\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\nkey identifier combination. \n\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\n\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\nto a bad timestamp.\n\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\n\n\n## Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\n        user: \'Steve\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    // Authenticate incoming request\n\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\n\n        // Prepare response\n\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\n\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\n\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\n\n        // Send the response back\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\n        res.end(payload);\n    });\n};\n\n// Start server\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nClient code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Request options\n\nvar requestOptions = {\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {}\n};\n\n// Generate Authorization request header\n\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\n\n// Send authenticated request\n\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\n\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\n\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\n\n    // Output results\n\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\n});\n```\n\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\n\n```javascript\nHawk.sntp.start();\n```\n\n\n## Protocol Example\n\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\nthe resource server:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\n```\n\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\n```\n\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\n\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\n* Algorithm: sha256\n\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\ncharacter):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nGET\n/resource/1?b=1&a=2\nexample.com\n8000\n\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\n\n```\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\n```\n\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\n```\n\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\n\n\n### Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\n* `hawk.1.payload`\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\n\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.payload\ntext/plain\nThank you for flying Hawk\n\n```\n\nWhich produces the following hash value:\n\n```\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\n```\n\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nPOST\n/resource/1?a=1&b=2\nexample.com\n8000\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nPOST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\n```\n\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\nand the nature of the data included.\n\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\n\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\n\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\n\n\n## Response Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\n\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\n\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\n\n```\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\n\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\n\n\n# Single URI Authorization\n\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\n\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\n\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\nthe granted access timeframe. \n\n\n## Bewit Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\n    });\n};\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nBewit code generation:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Generate bewit\n\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\n```\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\n\n### MAC Keys Transmission\n\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\n\n### Confidentiality of Requests\n\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\nto protect sensitive resources.\n\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\n\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\n\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\n\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\n\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\n\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\naccess.\n\n### Entropy of Keys\n\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\ncredentials are valid.\n\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\nlongest key reasonable.\n\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\n\n### Coverage Limitations\n\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\n\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\n\n### Future Time Manipulation\n\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\n\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\n\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\n\n### Client Clock Poisoning\n\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\nthat particular server.\n\n### Bewit Limitations\n\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\nand sensitive information.\n\n### Host Header Forgery\n\nHawk validates the incoming request MAC against the incoming HTTP Host header. However, unless the optional `host` and `port`\noptions are used with `server.authenticate()`, a malicous client can mint new host names pointing to the server\'s IP address and\nuse that to craft an attack by sending a valid request that\'s meant for another hostname than the one used by the server. Server\nimplementors must manually verify that the host header received matches their expectation (or use the options mentioned above).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Where is the protocol specification?\n\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\nsomething? Open an issue!\n\n### Is it done?\n\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\nand suggestions.\n\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\n\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, it has been ported to other languages.\nThe full list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port&state=closed). Please add an issue if you are\nworking on another port. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\n\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\n\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\n\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\n\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\n\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\n\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\n\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\n\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\n\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\n\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\n\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\n\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\n\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\n\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\nat work to produce more garbage.\n\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\n\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\n',

34991 silly resolved     readme: '# bl *(BufferList)*\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl)\n\n**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/bl.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n\n**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!\n\nThe original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(\'hi\')                     // bl will also accept & convert Strings\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer([ 0x3, 0x4 ]))\n\nconsole.log(bl.length) // 12\n\nconsole.log(bl.slice(0, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'abcdefghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'defghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 6).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'def\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 8).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(5, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'fghij\'\n\n// or just use toString!\nconsole.log(bl.toString())               // \'abcdefghij\\u0003\\u0004\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 3, 8))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 5, 10)) // \'fghij\'\n\n// other standard Buffer readables\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16BE(10)) // 0x0304\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16LE(10)) // 0x0403\n```\n\nGive it a callback in the constructor and use it just like **[concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)**:\n\n```js\nconst bl = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs = require(\'fs\')\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'README.md\')\n  .pipe(bl(function (err, data) { // note \'new\' isn\'t strictly required\n    // `data` is a complete Buffer object containing the full data\n    console.log(data.toString())\n  }))\n```\n\nNote that when you use the *callback* method like this, the resulting `data` parameter is a concatenation of all `Buffer` objects in the list. If you want to avoid the overhead of this concatenation (in cases of extreme performance consciousness), then avoid the *callback* method and just listen to `\'end\'` instead, like a standard Stream.\n\nOr to fetch a URL using [hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest) (should work with [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) and even plain Node http too!):\n```js\nconst hyperquest = require(\'hyperquest\')\n    , bl         = require(\'bl\')\n    , url        = \'https://raw.github.com/rvagg/bl/master/README.md\'\n\nhyperquest(url).pipe(bl(function (err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString())\n}))\n```\n\nOr, use it as a readable stream to recompose a list of Buffers to an output source:\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs         = require(\'fs\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'hi\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\n\nbl.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'gibberish.txt\'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n  * <a href="#ctor"><code><b>new BufferList([ callback ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#length"><code>bl.<b>length</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#append"><code>bl.<b>append(buffer)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#get"><code>bl.<b>get(index)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#slice"><code>bl.<b>slice([ start[, end ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#copy"><code>bl.<b>copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#duplicate"><code>bl.<b>duplicate()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#consume"><code>bl.<b>consume(bytes)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#toString"><code>bl.<b>toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#readXX"><code>bl.<b>readDoubleBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readDoubleLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt8()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt8()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#streams">Streams</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="ctor"></a>\n### new BufferList([ callback | buffer | buffer array ])\nThe constructor takes an optional callback, if supplied, the callback will be called with an error argument followed by a reference to the **bl** instance, when `bl.end()` is called (i.e. from a piped stream). This is a convenient method of collecting the entire contents of a stream, particularly when the stream is *chunky*, such as a network stream.\n\nNormally, no arguments are required for the constructor, but you can initialise the list by passing in a single `Buffer` object or an array of `Buffer` object.\n\n`new` is not strictly required, if you don\'t instantiate a new object, it will be done automatically for you so you can create a new instance simply with:\n\n```js\nvar bl = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = bl()\n\n// equivilant to:\n\nvar BufferList = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = new BufferList()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="length"></a>\n### bl.length\nGet the length of the list in bytes. This is the sum of the lengths of all of the buffers contained in the list, minus any initial offset for a semi-consumed buffer at the beginning. Should accurately represent the total number of bytes that can be read from the list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="append"></a>\n### bl.append(buffer)\n`append(buffer)` adds an additional buffer or BufferList to the internal list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="get"></a>\n### bl.get(index)\n`get()` will return the byte at the specified index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="slice"></a>\n### bl.slice([ start, [ end ] ])\n`slice()` returns a new `Buffer` object containing the bytes within the range specified. Both `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\nIf the requested range spans a single internal buffer then a slice of that buffer will be returned which shares the original memory range of that Buffer. If the range spans multiple buffers then copy operations will likely occur to give you a uniform Buffer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="copy"></a>\n### bl.copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])\n`copy()` copies the content of the list in the `dest` buffer, starting from `destStart` and containing the bytes within the range specified with `srcStart` to `srcEnd`. `destStart`, `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning of the `dest` buffer, and the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="duplicate"></a>\n### bl.duplicate()\n`duplicate()` performs a **shallow-copy** of the list. The internal Buffers remains the same, so if you change the underlying Buffers, the change will be reflected in both the original and the duplicate. This method is needed if you want to call `consume()` or `pipe()` and still keep the original list.Example:\n\n```js\nvar bl = new BufferList()\n\nbl.append(\'hello\')\nbl.append(\' world\')\nbl.append(\'\\n\')\n\nbl.duplicate().pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })\n\nconsole.log(bl.toString())\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="consume"></a>\n### bl.consume(bytes)\n`consume()` will shift bytes *off the start of the list*. The number of bytes consumed don\'t need to line up with the sizes of the internal Buffers&mdash;initial offsets will be calculated accordingly in order to give you a consistent view of the data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="toString"></a>\n### bl.toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])\n`toString()` will return a string representation of the buffer. The optional `start` and `end` arguments are passed on to `slice()`, while the `encoding` is passed on to `toString()` of the resulting Buffer. See the [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end) documentation for more information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="readXX"></a>\n### <code>bl.readDoubleBE()</code>, <code>bl.readDoubleLE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatBE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatLE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt8()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt8()</code>\n\nAll of the standard byte-reading methods of the `Buffer` interface are implemented and will operate across internal Buffer boundaries transparently.\n\nSee the <b><code>[Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html)</code></b> documentation for how these work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="streams"></a>\n### Streams\n**bl** is a Node **[Duplex Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)**, so it can be read from and written to like a standard Node stream. You can also `pipe()` to and from a **bl** instance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Contributors\n\n**bl** is brought to you by the following hackers:\n\n * [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg)\n * [Matteo Collina](https://github.com/mcollina)\n\n=======\n\n## License\n\n**bl** is Copyright (c) 2013 Rod Vagg [@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg) and licenced under the MIT licence.

This means if you attempt to parse a string like\n`\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\'` your resulting object will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  a: {\n    b: {\n      c: {\n        d: {\n          e: {\n            f: {\n              \'[g][h][i]\': \'j\'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `Qs.parse(string, depth)`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\', 1);\n// { a: { b: { \'[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]\': \'j\' } } }\n```\n\nThe depth limit mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number.\n\nAn optional delimiter can also be passed:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d\', \';\');\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }\n```\n\n### Parsing Arrays\n\n**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=b&a[]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nYou may specify an index as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=c&a[0]=b\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number\nto create an array. When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving\ntheir order:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b&a[15]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=&a[]=b\');\n// { a: [\'\', \'b\'] }\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[1]=&a[2]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\n**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`. Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will\ninstead be converted to an object with the index as the key:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[100]=b\');\n// { a: { \'100\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nIf you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[b]=c\');\n// { a: { \'0\': \'b\', b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also create arrays of objects:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[][b]=c\');\n// { a: [{ b: \'c\' }] }\n```\n\n### Stringifying\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify(object, [delimiter]);\n```\n\nWhen stringifying, **qs** always URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\' });\n// \'a=b\'\nQs.stringify({ a: { b: \'c\' } });\n// \'a%5Bb%5D=c\'\n```\n\nExamples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity. Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.\n\nWhen arrays are stringified, they are always given explicit indices:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] });\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c&a[2]=d\'\n```\n\nEmpty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'\' });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nProperties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nThe delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }, \';\');\n// \'a=b;c=d\'\n```\n',

The last\nis an argument that\'s only used when the object has been seen already.\n\nThe default `decycler` function returns the string `\'[Circular]\'`.\nIf, for example, you pass in `function(k,v){}` (return nothing) then it\nwill prune cycles.  If you pass in `function(k,v){ return {foo: \'bar\'}}`,\nthen cyclical objects will always be represented as `{"foo":"bar"}` in\nthe result.\n\n```\nstringify.getSerialize(serializer, decycler)\n```\n\nReturns a serializer that can be used elsewhere.

Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )\n* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall it in your browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="uuid.js"></script>\n```\n\nOr in node.js:\n\n```\nnpm install node-uuid\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar uuid = require(\'node-uuid\');\n```\n\nThen create some ids ...\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a v1 (time-based) id\nuuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n\n// Generate a v4 (random) id\nuuid.v4(); // -> \'110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1\'\n```\n\n## API\n\n### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The randomly generated node id is only guaranteed to stay constant for the lifetime of the current JS runtime. (Future versions of this module may use persistent storage mechanisms to extend this guarantee.)\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v1({\n  node: [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab],\n  clockseq: 0x1234,\n  msecs: new Date(\'2011-11-01\').getTime(),\n  nsecs: 5678\n});   // -> "710b962e-041c-11e1-9234-0123456789ab"\n```\n\nExample: In-place generation of two binary IDs\n\n```javascript\n// Generate two ids in an array\nvar arr = new Array(32); // -> []\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 0);   // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 16);  // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15 02 a3 1c b0 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\n\n// Optionally use uuid.unparse() to get stringify the ids\nuuid.unparse(buffer);    // -> \'02a2ce90-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\nuuid.unparse(buffer, 16) // -> \'02a31cb0-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\n```\n\n### uuid.v4([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v4 UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\n> cd test\n> node test.js\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the [XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n[streams2-thing]: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_versions\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, call ```submit(url, [callback])``` method:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'http://example.org/\', function(err, res) {\n  // res – response object (http.IncomingMessage)  //\n  res.resume(); // for node-0.10.x\n});\n\n```\n\nFor more advanced request manipulations ```submit()``` method returns ```http.ClientRequest``` object, or you can choose from one of the alternative submission methods.\n\n### Alternative submission methods\n\nYou can use node\'s http client interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (```fs.readStream```, ```http.response``` and ```mikeal\'s request```), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nIn case you need to also send custom HTTP headers with the POST request, you can use the `headers` key in first parameter of `form.submit()`:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/surelynot.php\',\n  headers: {\'x-test-header\': \'test-header-value\'}\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- ```getLengthSync()``` method DOESN\'T calculate length for streams, use ```knownLength``` options as workaround.\n- If it feels like FormData hangs after submit and you\'re on ```node-0.10```, please check [Compatibility with Older Node Versions][streams2-thing]\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

35926 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list.

If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the `callback` should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Examples__\n\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names \n\nasync.each(openFiles, function( file, callback) {\n  \n  // Perform operation on file here.\n  console.log(\'Processing file \' + file);\n  \n  if( file.length > 32 ) {\n    console.log(\'This file name is too long\');\n    callback(\'File name too long\');\n  } else {\n    // Do work to process file here\n    console.log(\'File processed\');\n    callback();\n  }\n}, function(err){\n    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error\n    if( err ) {\n      // One of the iterations produced an error.\n      // All processing will now stop.\n      console.log(\'A file failed to process\');\n    } else {\n      console.log(\'All files have been processed successfully\');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries.

If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through\nthe `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: \nan `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to this \ncallback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. \nHowever, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs.

The result is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="select" />\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `select`\n\nReturns a new array of all the values in `arr` which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The `iterator` is passed a `callback(truthValue)`, which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="selectSeries" />\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `selectSeries`\n\nThe same as [`filter`](#filter) only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries.

The `iterator` is passed a\n  `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* `callback(err, result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `foldr`\n\nSame as [`reduce`](#reduce), only operates on `arr` in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in `arr` that passes an async truth test. The\n`iterator` is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return `true` will\nfire the detect `callback` with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original `arr` (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original `arr` is important, then look at [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(truthValue)` which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the `iterator` functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value `undefined` if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`detect`](#detect), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original `arr` (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each `arr` value through an async `iterator`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, sortValue)` which must be called once it\n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a value to use as the sort\n  criteria.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is the items from\n  the original `arr` sorted by the values returned by the `iterator` calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n    fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n        callback(err, stats.mtime);\n    });\n}, function(err, results){\n    // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n    // modified date\n});\n```\n\n__Sort Order__\n\nBy modifying the callback parameter the sorting order can be influenced:\n\n```js\n//ascending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x);\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n\n//descending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x*-1);    //<- x*-1 instead of x, turns the order around\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `any`\n\nReturns `true` if at least one element in the `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. Once any iterator\ncall returns `true`, the main `callback` is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel. The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be \n  called with a boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either `true` or `false` depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `all`\n\nReturns `true` if every element in `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel.

Returns the\nconcatenated list. The `iterator`s are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of `arr` passed to the `iterator` function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, results)` which must be called once it \n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and an array of results.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the `iterator` function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n    // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as [`concat`](#concat), but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun the functions in the `tasks` array in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run, and `callback` is immediately called with the value of the error. \nOtherwise, `callback` receives an array of results when `tasks` have completed.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function, and the results will be passed to the final `callback` as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\n[`series`](#series).\n\n**Note** that while many implementations preserve the order of object properties, the\n[ECMAScript Language Specifcation](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.6) \nexplicitly states that\n\n> The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified.\n\nSo if you rely on the order in which your series of functions are executed, and want\nthis to work on all platforms, consider using an array. \n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a `callback(err, result)` it must call on completion with an error `err` (which can\n  be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed.

Note the argument ordering differs from `until`.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forever" />\n### forever(fn, errback)\n\nCalls the asynchronous function `fn` with a callback parameter that allows it to\ncall itself again, in series, indefinitely.\n\nIf an error is passed to the callback then `errback` is called with the\nerror, and execution stops, otherwise it will never be called.\n\n```js\nasync.forever(\n    function(next) {\n        // next is suitable for passing to things that need a callback(err [, whatever]);\n        // it will result in this function being called again.\n    },\n    function(err) {\n        // if next is called with a value in its first parameter, it will appear\n        // in here as \'err\', and execution will stop.\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns the `tasks` array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the `tasks` pass an error to their own callback, the\nnext function is not executed, and the main `callback` is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a \n  `callback(err, result1, result2, ...)` it must call on completion. The first\n  argument is an error (which can be `null`) and any further arguments will be \n  passed as arguments in order to the next task.\n* `callback(err, [results])` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.waterfall([\n    function(callback){\n        callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n      // arg1 now equals \'one\' and arg2 now equals \'two\'\n        callback(null, \'three\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, callback){\n        // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n        callback(null, \'done\');\n    }\n], function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals \'done\'    \n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="compose" />\n### compose(fn1, fn2...)\n\nCreates a function which is a composition of the passed asynchronous\nfunctions. Each function consumes the return value of the function that\nfollows. Composing functions `f()`, `g()`, and `h()` would produce the result of\n`f(g(h()))`, only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values.\n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `functions...` - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nfunction add1(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n + 1);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nfunction mul3(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n * 3);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nvar add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1);\n\nadd1mul3(4, function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 15\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="seq" />\n### seq(fn1, fn2...)\n\nVersion of the compose function that is more natural to read.\nEach following function consumes the return value of the latter function. \n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* functions... - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Requires lodash (or underscore), express3 and dresende\'s orm2.\n// Part of an app, that fetches cats of the logged user.\n// This example uses `seq` function to avoid overnesting and error \n// handling clutter.\napp.get(\'/cats\', function(request, response) {\n  function handleError(err, data, callback) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err);\n      response.json({ status: \'error\', message: err.message });\n    }\n    else {\n      callback(data);\n    }\n  }\n  var User = request.models.User;\n  async.seq(\n    _.bind(User.get, User),  // \'User.get\' has signature (id, callback(err, data))\n    handleError,\n    function(user, fn) {\n      user.getCats(fn);      // \'getCats\' has signature (callback(err, data))\n    },\n    handleError,\n    function(cats) {\n      response.json({ status: \'ok\', message: \'Cats found\', data: cats });\n    }\n  )(req.session.user_id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="applyEach" />\n### applyEach(fns, args..., callback)\n\nApplies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling \n`callback` after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first\nargument, then it will return a function which lets you pass in the\narguments as if it were a single function call.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fns` - the asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments\n* `args...` - any number of separate arguments to pass to the function\n* `callback` - the final argument should be the callback, called when all\n  functions have completed processing\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], \'bucket\', callback);\n\n// partial application example:\nasync.each(\n    buckets,\n    async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]),\n    callback\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="applyEachSeries" />\n### applyEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`applyEach`](#applyEach) only the functions are applied in series.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a `queue` object with the specified `concurrency`. Tasks added to the\n`queue` are processed in parallel (up to the `concurrency` limit). If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an array of\n  `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.\n* The `unshift` method was removed.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a `cargo` object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the `payload` limit). If the\n`worker` is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once\nthe `worker` has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\nCheck out [this animation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bbd36f4cf5b35a0f11a96dcd2e97711ffc2fb37/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313637363837312f36383130382f62626330636662302d356632392d313165322d393734662d3333393763363464633835382e676966) for how `cargo` and `queue` work.\n\nWhile [queue](#queue) passes only one task to one of a group of workers\nat a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating\nwhen the worker is finished.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(tasks, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with \n  an optional `err` argument.\n* `payload` - An optional `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe `cargo` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - A function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `payload` - An `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

35926 silly resolved     readme: '# combined-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream)\n\nA stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install combined-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine\ntwo files into one:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nWhile the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until\nthey are needed. If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

35926 silly resolved     readme: '# mime\n\nComprehensive MIME type mapping API. Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project, plus additional types submitted by the node.js community.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install mime\n\n## API - Queries\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\nGet the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `path` (the substring after the last \'/\' or \'.\').  E.g.\n\n    var mime = require(\'mime\');\n\n    mime.lookup(\'/path/to/file.txt\');         // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'file.txt\');                  // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'.TXT\');                      // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'htm\');                       // => \'text/html\'\n\n### mime.default_type\nSets the mime type returned when `mime.lookup` fails to find the extension searched for. (Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require(\'assert-plus\');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, \'options\');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, \'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, \'options.isManager\');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, \'options.name\');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, \'options.email\');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, \'callback\');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren\'t* part of node\'s core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string \'name\' that\'s not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, \'foo\');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don\'t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Its name comes from the C header file.\n\nTo get started, simply clone the repository or use npm to install it. Once it is\nthere, simply require it.\n\ngit clone git://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype\nnpm install ctype\nvar mod_ctype = require(\'ctype\')\n\n\nThere are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction you\'d like.\nThe low level API let\'s you read and write individual integers and floats from\nbuffers. The higher level API let\'s you read and write structures of these. To\nillustrate this, let\'s looks look at how we would read and write a binary\nencoded x,y point.\n\nIn C we would define this structure as follows:\n\ntypedef struct point {\n\tuint16_t\tp_x;\n\tuint16_t\tp_y;\n} point_t;\n\nTo read a binary encoded point from a Buffer, we first need to create a CType\nparser (where we specify the endian and other options) and add the typedef.\n\nvar parser = new mod_ctype.Parser({ endian: \'big\' });\nparser.typedef(\'point_t\', [\n\t{ x: { type: \'uint16_t\' } },\n\t{ y: { type: \'uint16_t\' } }\n]);\n\nFrom here, given a buffer buf and an offset into it, we can read a point.\n\nvar out = parser.readData([ { point: { type: \'point_t\' } } ], buffer, 0);\nconsole.log(out);\n{ point: { x: 23, y: 42 } }\n\nAnother way to get the same information would be to use the low level methods.\nNote that these require you to manually deal with the offset. Here\'s how we\'d\nget the same values of x and y from the buffer.\n\nvar x = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 0);\nvar y = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 2);\nconsole.log(x + \', \' + y);\n23, 42\n\nThe true power of this API comes from the ability to define and nest typedefs,\njust as you would in C. By default, the following types are defined by default.\nNote that they return a Number, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n    * int8_t\n    * int16_t\n    * int32_t\n    * int64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * uint8_t\n    * uint16_t\n    * uint32_t\n    * uint64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * float\n    * double\n    * char (either returns a buffer with that character or a uint8_t)\n    * char[] (returns an object with the buffer and the number of characters read which is either the total amount requested or until the first 0)\n\n\nctf2json integration:\n\nNode-CType supports consuming the output of ctf2json. Once you read in a JSON file,\nall you have to do to add all the definitions it contains is:\n\nvar data, parser;\ndata = JSON.parse(parsedJSONData);\nparser = mod_ctype.parseCTF(data, { endian: \'big\' });\n\nFor more documentation, see the file README.old. Full documentation is in the\nprocess of being rewritten as a series of manual pages which will be available\nin the repository and online for viewing.\n\nTo read the ctio manual page simple run, from the root of the workspace:\n\nman -Mman -s 3ctype ctio\n',

36342 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

36881 silly resolved     readme: '# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](http://api.nodejs.org/fs.html)\n\ngraceful-fs:\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n',

If `opts` is a non-object, it will be treated as\nthe `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\n`cb(err, made)` fires with the error or the first directory `made`\nthat had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdir(path, mode, cb)` and\n`opts.fs.stat(path, cb)`.\n\n## mkdirp.sync(dir, opts)\n\nSynchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir`\nwith octal permission string `opts.mode`. If `opts` is a non-object, it will be\ntreated as the `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\nReturns the first directory that had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdirSync(path, mode)` and\n`opts.fs.statSync(path)`.\n\n# usage\n\nThis package also ships with a `mkdirp` command.\n\n```\nusage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] {OPTIONS}\n\n  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that\n  don\'t yet exist.\n  \n  If the directory already exists, do nothing.\n\nOPTIONS are:\n\n  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal\n               permission string.\n\n```\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the library, or\n\n```\nnpm install -g mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the command.\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n',

Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)\n* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)\n* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)\n* [`punycode.js` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/426298c8c1c0d5b5224ac3658c41e7c2a3fe9377/lib/punycode.js) (note: [not fully compliant](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2072))\n\nThis project is [bundled](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/punycode.js) with [Node.js v0.6.2+](https://github.com/joyent/node/compare/975f1930b1...61e796decc).\n\n## Installation\n\nVia [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (only required for Node.js releases older than v0.6.2):\n\n```bash\nnpm install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```bash\nbower install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Component](https://github.com/component/component):\n\n```bash\ncomponent install bestiejs/punycode.js\n```\n\nIn a browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="punycode.js"></script>\n```\n\nIn [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):\n\n```js\nvar punycode = require(\'punycode\');\n```\n\nIn [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):\n\n```js\nload(\'punycode.js\');\n```\n\nUsing an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\n\n```js\nrequire(\n  {\n    \'paths\': {\n      \'punycode\': \'path/to/punycode\'\n    }\n  },\n  [\'punycode\'],\n  function(punycode) {\n    console.log(punycode);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `punycode.decode(string)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string of ASCII symbols to a string of Unicode symbols.\n\n```js\n// decode domain name parts\npunycode.decode(\'maana-pta\'); // \'mañana\'\npunycode.decode(\'--dqo34k\'); // \'☃-⌘\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.encode(string)`\n\nConverts a string of Unicode symbols to a Punycode string of ASCII symbols.\n\n```js\n// encode domain name parts\npunycode.encode(\'mañana\'); // \'maana-pta\'\npunycode.encode(\'☃-⌘\'); // \'--dqo34k\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toUnicode(input)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string representing a domain name or an email address to Unicode. Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.\n\n```js\n// decode domain names\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn--maana-pta.com\');\n// → \'mañana.com\'\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn----dqo34k.com\');\n// → \'☃-⌘.com\'\n\n// decode email addresses\npunycode.toUnicode(\'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\');\n// → \'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toASCII(input)`\n\nConverts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that\'s already in ASCII.\n\n```js\n// encode domain names\npunycode.toASCII(\'mañana.com\');\n// → \'xn--maana-pta.com\'\npunycode.toASCII(\'☃-⌘.com\');\n// → \'xn----dqo34k.com\'\n\n// encode email addresses\npunycode.toASCII(\'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\');\n// → \'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.ucs2`\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`\n\nCreates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'abc\');\n// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]\n// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'\\uD834\\uDF06\');\n// → [0x1D306]\n```\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`\n\nCreates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);\n// → \'abc\'\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);\n// → \'\\uD834\\uDF06\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.version`\n\nA string representing the current Punycode.js version number.\n\n## Unit tests & code coverage\n\nAfter cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.\n\nOnce that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.\n\nTo generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n## Author\n\n| [![twitter/mathias](https://gravatar.com/avatar/24e08a9ea84deb17ae121074d0f17125?s=70)](https://twitter.com/mathias "Follow @mathias on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/) |\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [![twitter/jdalton](https://gravatar.com/avatar/299a3d891ff1920b69c364d061007043?s=70)](https://twitter.com/jdalton "Follow @jdalton on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) |\n\n## License\n\nPunycode.js is available under the [MIT](http://mths.be/mit) license.\n',

37465 silly resolved     readme: '# Source Map\n\nThis is a library to generate and consume the source map format\n[described here][format].\n\nThis library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works\nin the following environments:\n\n* Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an\n  AMD loader such as RequireJS)\n\n* Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)\n\n* With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher\n\n## Node\n\n    $ npm install source-map\n\n## Building from Source (for everywhere else)\n\nInstall Node and then run\n\n    $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git\n    $ cd source-map\n    $ npm link .\n\nNext, run\n\n    $ node Makefile.dryice.js\n\nThis should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:\n\n* `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.\n\n* `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.\n\n* `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Consuming a source map\n\n    var rawSourceMap = {\n      version: 3,\n      file: \'min.js\',\n      names: [\'bar\', \'baz\', \'n\'],\n      sources: [\'one.js\', \'two.js\'],\n      sourceRoot: \'http://example.com/www/js/\',\n      mappings: \'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA\'\n    };\n\n    var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);\n\n    console.log(smc.sources);\n    // [ \'http://example.com/www/js/one.js\',\n    //   \'http://example.com/www/js/two.js\' ]\n\n    console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({\n      line: 2,\n      column: 28\n    }));\n    // { source: \'http://example.com/www/js/two.js\',\n    //   line: 2,\n    //   column: 10,\n    //   name: \'n\' }\n\n    console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({\n      source: \'http://example.com/www/js/two.js\',\n      line: 2,\n      column: 10\n    }));\n    // { line: 2, column: 28 }\n\n    smc.eachMapping(function (m) {\n      // ...\n    });\n\n### Generating a source map\n\nIn depth guide:\n[**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)\n\n#### With SourceNode (high level API)\n\n    function compile(ast) {\n      switch (ast.type) {\n      case \'BinaryExpression\':\n        return new SourceNode(\n          ast.location.line,\n          ast.location.column,\n          ast.location.source,\n          [compile(ast.left), " + ", compile(ast.right)]\n        );\n      case \'Literal\':\n        return new SourceNode(\n          ast.location.line,\n          ast.location.column,\n          ast.location.source,\n          String(ast.value)\n        );\n      // ...\n      default:\n        throw new Error("Bad AST");\n      }\n    }\n\n    var ast = parse("40 + 2", "add.js");\n    console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({\n      file: \'add.js\'\n    }));\n    // { code: \'40 + 2\',\n    //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] }\n\n#### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)\n\n    var map = new SourceMapGenerator({\n      file: "source-mapped.js"\n    });\n\n    map.addMapping({\n      generated: {\n        line: 10,\n        column: 35\n      },\n      source: "foo.js",\n      original: {\n        line: 33,\n        column: 2\n      },\n      name: "christopher"\n    });\n\n    console.log(map.toString());\n    // \'{"version":3,"file":"source-mapped.js","sources":["foo.js"],"names":["christopher"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA"}\'\n\n## API\n\nGet a reference to the module:\n\n    // NodeJS\n    var sourceMap = require(\'source-map\');\n\n    // Browser builds\n    var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;\n\n    // Inside Firefox\n    let sourceMap = {};\n    Components.utils.import(\'resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm\', sourceMap);\n\n### SourceMapConsumer\n\nA SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query\nfor information about the original file positions by giving it a file position\nin the generated source.\n\n#### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)\n\nThe only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be\n`JSON.parse`\'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource\'s line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source)\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file\'s line/column order or the\n  original\'s source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource\'s line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren\'t in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `\'.\'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn\'t associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn\'t associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source\'s filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source\'s line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node\'s children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with "test", for example\n\n    exports["test doing the foo bar"] = function (assert, util) {\n      ...\n    };\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node\'s assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox\'s test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice\n',

Also, you can use this to set\nthe stats on a file, even if you don\'t change its contents, or to create\na symlink, etc.\n\nSo, for example, you can "write" a directory, and it\'ll call `mkdir`.  You\ncan specify a uid and gid, and it\'ll call `chown`.  You can specify a\n`mtime` and `atime`, and it\'ll call `utimes`.  You can call it a symlink\nand provide a `linkpath` and it\'ll call `symlink`.\n\nNote that it won\'t automatically resolve symbolic links.  So, if you\ncall `fstream.Reader(\'/some/symlink\')` then you\'ll get an object\nthat stats and then ends immediately (since it has no data).  To follow\nsymbolic links, do this: `fstream.Reader({path:\'/some/symlink\', follow:\ntrue })`.\n\nThere are various checks to make sure that the bytes emitted are the\nsame as the intended size, if the size is set.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nThis will create the directories if they\'re missing, and then write\n`hello\\n` into the file, chmod it to 0755, and assert that 6 bytes have\nbeen written when it\'s done.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          , flags: "a"\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nYou can pass flags in, if you want to append to a file.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/symlink"\n          , linkpath: "./file"\n          , SymbolicLink: true\n          , mode: "0755" // octal strings supported\n          })\n  .end()\n```\n\nIf isSymbolicLink is a function, it\'ll be called, and if it returns\ntrue, then it\'ll treat it as a symlink.  If it\'s not a function, then\nany truish value will make a symlink, or you can set `type:\n\'SymbolicLink\'`, which does the same thing.\n\nNote that the linkpath is relative to the symbolic link location, not\nthe parent dir or cwd.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Reader("path/to/dir")\n  .pipe(fstream.Writer("path/to/other/dir"))\n```\n\nThis will do like `cp -Rp path/to/dir path/to/other/dir`.  If the other\ndir exists and isn\'t a directory, then it\'ll emit an error.  It\'ll also\nset the uid, gid, mode, etc. to be identical.  In this way, it\'s more\nlike `rsync -a` than simply a copy.\n',

37512 silly resolved     readme: 'Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js\n[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).\n\nThis package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in\nnode environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly\nimplementation through [browser\nfield](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

38179 silly resolved     readme: '# bl *(BufferList)*\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl)\n\n**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/bl.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n\n**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!\n\nThe original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(\'hi\')                     // bl will also accept & convert Strings\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer([ 0x3, 0x4 ]))\n\nconsole.log(bl.length) // 12\n\nconsole.log(bl.slice(0, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'abcdefghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'defghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 6).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'def\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 8).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(5, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'fghij\'\n\n// or just use toString!\nconsole.log(bl.toString())               // \'abcdefghij\\u0003\\u0004\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 3, 8))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 5, 10)) // \'fghij\'\n\n// other standard Buffer readables\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16BE(10)) // 0x0304\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16LE(10)) // 0x0403\n```\n\nGive it a callback in the constructor and use it just like **[concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)**:\n\n```js\nconst bl = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs = require(\'fs\')\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'README.md\')\n  .pipe(bl(function (err, data) { // note \'new\' isn\'t strictly required\n    // `data` is a complete Buffer object containing the full data\n    console.log(data.toString())\n  }))\n```\n\nNote that when you use the *callback* method like this, the resulting `data` parameter is a concatenation of all `Buffer` objects in the list. If you want to avoid the overhead of this concatenation (in cases of extreme performance consciousness), then avoid the *callback* method and just listen to `\'end\'` instead, like a standard Stream.\n\nOr to fetch a URL using [hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest) (should work with [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) and even plain Node http too!):\n```js\nconst hyperquest = require(\'hyperquest\')\n    , bl         = require(\'bl\')\n    , url        = \'https://raw.github.com/rvagg/bl/master/README.md\'\n\nhyperquest(url).pipe(bl(function (err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString())\n}))\n```\n\nOr, use it as a readable stream to recompose a list of Buffers to an output source:\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs         = require(\'fs\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'hi\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\n\nbl.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'gibberish.txt\'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n  * <a href="#ctor"><code><b>new BufferList([ callback ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#length"><code>bl.<b>length</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#append"><code>bl.<b>append(buffer)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#get"><code>bl.<b>get(index)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#slice"><code>bl.<b>slice([ start[, end ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#copy"><code>bl.<b>copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#duplicate"><code>bl.<b>duplicate()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#consume"><code>bl.<b>consume(bytes)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#toString"><code>bl.<b>toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#readXX"><code>bl.<b>readDoubleBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readDoubleLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt8()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt8()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#streams">Streams</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="ctor"></a>\n### new BufferList([ callback | buffer | buffer array ])\nThe constructor takes an optional callback, if supplied, the callback will be called with an error argument followed by a reference to the **bl** instance, when `bl.end()` is called (i.e. from a piped stream). This is a convenient method of collecting the entire contents of a stream, particularly when the stream is *chunky*, such as a network stream.\n\nNormally, no arguments are required for the constructor, but you can initialise the list by passing in a single `Buffer` object or an array of `Buffer` object.\n\n`new` is not strictly required, if you don\'t instantiate a new object, it will be done automatically for you so you can create a new instance simply with:\n\n```js\nvar bl = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = bl()\n\n// equivilant to:\n\nvar BufferList = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = new BufferList()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="length"></a>\n### bl.length\nGet the length of the list in bytes. This is the sum of the lengths of all of the buffers contained in the list, minus any initial offset for a semi-consumed buffer at the beginning. Should accurately represent the total number of bytes that can be read from the list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="append"></a>\n### bl.append(buffer)\n`append(buffer)` adds an additional buffer or BufferList to the internal list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="get"></a>\n### bl.get(index)\n`get()` will return the byte at the specified index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="slice"></a>\n### bl.slice([ start, [ end ] ])\n`slice()` returns a new `Buffer` object containing the bytes within the range specified. Both `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\nIf the requested range spans a single internal buffer then a slice of that buffer will be returned which shares the original memory range of that Buffer. If the range spans multiple buffers then copy operations will likely occur to give you a uniform Buffer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="copy"></a>\n### bl.copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])\n`copy()` copies the content of the list in the `dest` buffer, starting from `destStart` and containing the bytes within the range specified with `srcStart` to `srcEnd`. `destStart`, `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning of the `dest` buffer, and the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="duplicate"></a>\n### bl.duplicate()\n`duplicate()` performs a **shallow-copy** of the list. The internal Buffers remains the same, so if you change the underlying Buffers, the change will be reflected in both the original and the duplicate. This method is needed if you want to call `consume()` or `pipe()` and still keep the original list.Example:\n\n```js\nvar bl = new BufferList()\n\nbl.append(\'hello\')\nbl.append(\' world\')\nbl.append(\'\\n\')\n\nbl.duplicate().pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })\n\nconsole.log(bl.toString())\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="consume"></a>\n### bl.consume(bytes)\n`consume()` will shift bytes *off the start of the list*. The number of bytes consumed don\'t need to line up with the sizes of the internal Buffers&mdash;initial offsets will be calculated accordingly in order to give you a consistent view of the data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="toString"></a>\n### bl.toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])\n`toString()` will return a string representation of the buffer. The optional `start` and `end` arguments are passed on to `slice()`, while the `encoding` is passed on to `toString()` of the resulting Buffer. See the [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end) documentation for more information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="readXX"></a>\n### <code>bl.readDoubleBE()</code>, <code>bl.readDoubleLE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatBE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatLE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt8()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt8()</code>\n\nAll of the standard byte-reading methods of the `Buffer` interface are implemented and will operate across internal Buffer boundaries transparently.\n\nSee the <b><code>[Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html)</code></b> documentation for how these work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="streams"></a>\n### Streams\n**bl** is a Node **[Duplex Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)**, so it can be read from and written to like a standard Node stream.

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\nincluded in its place.\n\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\n\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\n\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\n  to send an authenticated request), and\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\n\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\n\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\nand the server.\n\n\n## Replay Protection\n\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\nkey identifier combination. \n\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\n\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\nto a bad timestamp.\n\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\n\n\n## Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\n        user: \'Steve\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    // Authenticate incoming request\n\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\n\n        // Prepare response\n\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\n\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\n\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\n\n        // Send the response back\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\n        res.end(payload);\n    });\n};\n\n// Start server\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nClient code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Request options\n\nvar requestOptions = {\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {}\n};\n\n// Generate Authorization request header\n\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\n\n// Send authenticated request\n\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\n\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\n\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\n\n    // Output results\n\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\n});\n```\n\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\n\n```javascript\nHawk.sntp.start();\n```\n\n\n## Protocol Example\n\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\nthe resource server:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\n```\n\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\n```\n\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\n\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\n* Algorithm: sha256\n\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\ncharacter):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nGET\n/resource/1?b=1&a=2\nexample.com\n8000\n\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\n\n```\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\n```\n\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\n```\n\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\n\n\n### Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\n* `hawk.1.payload`\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\n\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.payload\ntext/plain\nThank you for flying Hawk\n\n```\n\nWhich produces the following hash value:\n\n```\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\n```\n\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nPOST\n/resource/1?a=1&b=2\nexample.com\n8000\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nPOST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\n```\n\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\nand the nature of the data included.\n\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\n\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\n\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\n\n\n## Response Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\n\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\n\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\n\n```\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\n\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\n\n\n# Single URI Authorization\n\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\n\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\n\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\nthe granted access timeframe. \n\n\n## Bewit Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\n    });\n};\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nBewit code generation:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Generate bewit\n\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\n```\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\n\n### MAC Keys Transmission\n\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\n\n### Confidentiality of Requests\n\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\nto protect sensitive resources.\n\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\n\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\n\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\n\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\n\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\n\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\naccess.\n\n### Entropy of Keys\n\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\ncredentials are valid.\n\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\nlongest key reasonable.\n\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\n\n### Coverage Limitations\n\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\n\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\n\n### Future Time Manipulation\n\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\n\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\n\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\n\n### Client Clock Poisoning\n\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\nthat particular server.\n\n### Bewit Limitations\n\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\nand sensitive information.\n\n### Host Header Forgery\n\nHawk validates the incoming request MAC against the incoming HTTP Host header. However, unless the optional `host` and `port`\noptions are used with `server.authenticate()`, a malicous client can mint new host names pointing to the server\'s IP address and\nuse that to craft an attack by sending a valid request that\'s meant for another hostname than the one used by the server. Server\nimplementors must manually verify that the host header received matches their expectation (or use the options mentioned above).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Where is the protocol specification?\n\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\nsomething? Open an issue!\n\n### Is it done?\n\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\nand suggestions.\n\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\n\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, it has been ported to other languages.\nThe full list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port&state=closed). Please add an issue if you are\nworking on another port. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\n\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\n\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\n\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\n\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\n\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\n\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\n\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\n\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\n\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\n\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\n\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\n\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\n\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\n\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\nat work to produce more garbage.\n\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\n\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\n',

Feel free to add more!\n- Browser support via Browserify and Component by converting lists to JSON files.\n\nOtherwise, the API is compatible.\n\n### Adding Types\n\nIf you\'d like to add additional types,\nsimply create a PR adding the type to `custom.json` and\na reference link to the [sources](SOURCES.md).\n\nDo __NOT__ edit `mime.json` or `node.json`.\nThose are pulled using `build.js`.\nYou should only touch `custom.json`.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar mime = require(\'mime-types\')\n```\n\nAll functions return `false` if input is invalid or not found.\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\n\nLookup the content-type associated with a file.\n\n```js\nmime.lookup(\'json\')           // \'application/json\'\nmime.lookup(\'.md\')            // \'text/x-markdown\'\nmime.lookup(\'file.html\')      // \'text/html\'\nmime.lookup(\'folder/file.js\') // \'application/javascript\'\n\nmime.lookup(\'cats\') // false\n```\n\n### mime.contentType(type)\n\nCreate a full content-type header given a content-type or extension.\n\n```js\nmime.contentType(\'markdown\')  // \'text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8\'\nmime.contentType(\'file.json\') // \'application/json; charset=utf-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.extension(type)\n\nGet the default extension for a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\') // \'bin\'\n```\n\n### mime.charset(type)\n\nLookup the implied default charset of a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.charset(\'text/x-markdown\') // \'UTF-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.types[extension] = type\n\nA map of content-types by extension.\n\n### mime.extensions[type] = [extensions]\n\nA map of extensions by content-type.\n\n### mime.define(types)\n\nGlobally add definitions.\n`types` must be an object of the form:\n\n```js\n{\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...],\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...]\n}\n```\n\nSee the `.json` files in `lib/` for examples.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n',

Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )\n* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall it in your browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="uuid.js"></script>\n```\n\nOr in node.js:\n\n```\nnpm install node-uuid\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar uuid = require(\'node-uuid\');\n```\n\nThen create some ids ...\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a v1 (time-based) id\nuuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n\n// Generate a v4 (random) id\nuuid.v4(); // -> \'110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1\'\n```\n\n## API\n\n### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The randomly generated node id is only guaranteed to stay constant for the lifetime of the current JS runtime. (Future versions of this module may use persistent storage mechanisms to extend this guarantee.)\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v1({\n  node: [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab],\n  clockseq: 0x1234,\n  msecs: new Date(\'2011-11-01\').getTime(),\n  nsecs: 5678\n});   // -> "710b962e-041c-11e1-9234-0123456789ab"\n```\n\nExample: In-place generation of two binary IDs\n\n```javascript\n// Generate two ids in an array\nvar arr = new Array(32); // -> []\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 0);   // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 16);  // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15 02 a3 1c b0 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\n\n// Optionally use uuid.unparse() to get stringify the ids\nuuid.unparse(buffer);    // -> \'02a2ce90-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\nuuid.unparse(buffer, 16) // -> \'02a31cb0-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\n```\n\n### uuid.v4([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v4 UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\n> cd test\n> node test.js\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the [XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n[streams2-thing]: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_versions\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, call ```submit(url, [callback])``` method:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'http://example.org/\', function(err, res) {\n  // res – response object (http.IncomingMessage)  //\n  res.resume(); // for node-0.10.x\n});\n\n```\n\nFor more advanced request manipulations ```submit()``` method returns ```http.ClientRequest``` object, or you can choose from one of the alternative submission methods.\n\n### Alternative submission methods\n\nYou can use node\'s http client interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (```fs.readStream```, ```http.response``` and ```mikeal\'s request```), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nIn case you need to also send custom HTTP headers with the POST request, you can use the `headers` key in first parameter of `form.submit()`:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/surelynot.php\',\n  headers: {\'x-test-header\': \'test-header-value\'}\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- ```getLengthSync()``` method DOESN\'T calculate length for streams, use ```knownLength``` options as workaround.\n- If it feels like FormData hangs after submit and you\'re on ```node-0.10```, please check [Compatibility with Older Node Versions][streams2-thing]\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

38179 silly resolved     readme: '[RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js\n\n![Tough Cookie](http://www.goinstant.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tough-cookie.jpg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie)\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/tough-cookie)\n![NPM Downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/tough-cookie.png?months=9)\n\n# Synopsis\n\n``` javascript\nvar tough = require(\'tough-cookie\'); // note: not \'cookie\', \'cookies\' or \'node-cookie\'\nvar Cookie = tough.Cookie;\nvar cookie = Cookie.parse(header);\ncookie.value = \'somethingdifferent\';\nheader = cookie.toString();\n\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();\ncookiejar.setCookie(cookie, \'http://currentdomain.example.com/path\', cb);\n// ...\ncookiejar.getCookies(\'http://example.com/otherpath\',function(err,cookies) {\n  res.headers[\'cookie\'] = cookies.join(\'; \');\n});\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nIt\'s _so_ easy!\n\n`npm install tough-cookie`\n\nRequires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

38179 silly resolved     readme: '# qs\n\nA querystring parsing and stringifying library with some added security.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs)\n\nLead Maintainer: [Nathan LaFreniere](https://github.com/nlf)\n\nThe **qs** module was originally created and maintained by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring).\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Qs = require(\'qs\');\n\nvar obj = Qs.parse(\'a=c\');    // { a: \'c\' }\nvar str = Qs.stringify(obj);  // \'a=c\'\n```\n\n### Parsing Objects\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(string, [depth], [delimiter]);\n```\n\n**qs** allows you to create nested objects within your query strings, by surrounding the name of sub-keys with square brackets `[]`.\nFor example, the string `\'foo[bar]=baz\'` converts to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: \'baz\'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nURI encoded strings work too:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a%5Bb%5D=c\');\n// { a: { b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also nest your objects, like `\'foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz\'`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: {\n      baz: \'foobarbaz\'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, when nesting objects **qs** will only parse up to 5 children deep. This means if you attempt to parse a string like\n`\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\'` your resulting object will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  a: {\n    b: {\n      c: {\n        d: {\n          e: {\n            f: {\n              \'[g][h][i]\': \'j\'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `Qs.parse(string, depth)`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\', 1);\n// { a: { b: { \'[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]\': \'j\' } } }\n```\n\nThe depth limit mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number.\n\nAn optional delimiter can also be passed:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d\', \';\');\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }\n```\n\n### Parsing Arrays\n\n**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=b&a[]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nYou may specify an index as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=c&a[0]=b\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number\nto create an array. When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving\ntheir order:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b&a[15]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=&a[]=b\');\n// { a: [\'\', \'b\'] }\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[1]=&a[2]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\n**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`. Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will\ninstead be converted to an object with the index as the key:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[100]=b\');\n// { a: { \'100\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nIf you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[b]=c\');\n// { a: { \'0\': \'b\', b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also create arrays of objects:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[][b]=c\');\n// { a: [{ b: \'c\' }] }\n```\n\n### Stringifying\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify(object, [delimiter]);\n```\n\nWhen stringifying, **qs** always URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\' });\n// \'a=b\'\nQs.stringify({ a: { b: \'c\' } });\n// \'a%5Bb%5D=c\'\n```\n\nExamples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity. Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.\n\nWhen arrays are stringified, they are always given explicit indices:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] });\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c&a[2]=d\'\n```\n\nEmpty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'\' });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nProperties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nThe delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }, \';\');\n// \'a=b;c=d\'\n```\n',

38534 silly resolved     readme: '# EventEmitter3\n\nEventEmitter3 is a faster alternative to EventEmitter2 and the built-in\nEventEmitter that ships within Node.js. It removes some features that you might\nnot need:\n\n- Domain support.\n- Thrown errors when there are no error listeners specified.\n- That a `newListener` event is emitted when an event is emitted.\n- No silly `setMaxListeners`.\n- No silly `listenerCount` function.. Just do `EventEmitter.listeners(event).length`\n\nAnd adds some features you want:\n\n- Emit events with a custom context without binding: `EE.on(event, fn, context)`\n  which also works with once `EE.once(event, fn, context)`\n\nIt\'s a drop in replacement of your existing EventEmitters, but just faster. Free\nperformance, who wouldn\'t want that?\n\nThe source of the EventEmitter is compatible for browser usage, no fancy pancy\n`Array.isArray` stuff is used, it\'s just plain ol JavaScript that should even\nwork IE5 if you want to. This module currently serves its use in\n[Primus](http://github.com/primus/primus)\'s client file.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save eventemitter3\n```\nor as a [component](http://component.io)\n\n```bash\n$ component install eventemitter3\n```\n\nthen\n\n```js\nvar EventEmitter = require(\'eventemitter3\');\n\n// or\n\nvar EventEmitter = require(\'eventemitter3\').EventEmitter;\n```\n\nFor API methods see the official Node.js documentation: \n\nhttp://nodejs.org/api/events.html\n',

38845 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the `callback` should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Examples__\n\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names \n\nasync.each(openFiles, function( file, callback) {\n  \n  // Perform operation on file here.\n  console.log(\'Processing file \' + file);\n  \n  if( file.length > 32 ) {\n    console.log(\'This file name is too long\');\n    callback(\'File name too long\');\n  } else {\n    // Do work to process file here\n    console.log(\'File processed\');\n    callback();\n  }\n}, function(err){\n    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error\n    if( err ) {\n      // One of the iterations produced an error.\n      // All processing will now stop.\n      console.log(\'A file failed to process\');\n    } else {\n      console.log(\'All files have been processed successfully\');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThis means the `iterator` functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items in `arr` are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through\nthe `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: \nan `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to this \ncallback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. \nHowever, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries.

The result is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="select" />\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `select`\n\nReturns a new array of all the values in `arr` which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The `iterator` is passed a `callback(truthValue)`, which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="selectSeries" />\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `selectSeries`\n\nThe same as [`filter`](#filter) only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of [`filter`](#filter). Removes values that pass an `async` truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`reject`](#reject), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Aliases:__ `inject`, `foldl`\n\nReduces `arr` into a single value using an async `iterator` to return\neach successive step. `memo` is the initial state of the reduction. \nThis function only operates in series. \n\nFor performance reasons, it may make sense to split a call to this function into \na parallel map, and then use the normal `Array.prototype.reduce` on the results. \nThis function is for situations where each step in the reduction needs to be async; \nif you can get the data before reducing it, then it\'s probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `memo` - The initial state of the reduction.\n* `iterator(memo, item, callback)` - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The `iterator` is passed a\n  `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* `callback(err, result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `foldr`\n\nSame as [`reduce`](#reduce), only operates on `arr` in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in `arr` that passes an async truth test. The\n`iterator` is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return `true` will\nfire the detect `callback` with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original `arr` (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original `arr` is important, then look at [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(truthValue)` which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the `iterator` functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value `undefined` if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`detect`](#detect), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original `arr` (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each `arr` value through an async `iterator`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, sortValue)` which must be called once it\n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a value to use as the sort\n  criteria.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is the items from\n  the original `arr` sorted by the values returned by the `iterator` calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n    fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n        callback(err, stats.mtime);\n    });\n}, function(err, results){\n    // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n    // modified date\n});\n```\n\n__Sort Order__\n\nBy modifying the callback parameter the sorting order can be influenced:\n\n```js\n//ascending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x);\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n\n//descending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x*-1);    //<- x*-1 instead of x, turns the order around\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `any`\n\nReturns `true` if at least one element in the `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. Once any iterator\ncall returns `true`, the main `callback` is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel. The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be \n  called with a boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either `true` or `false` depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `all`\n\nReturns `true` if every element in `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel. The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be \n  called with a  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result will be either `true` or `false` depending on\n  the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.every([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then every file exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concat" />\n### concat(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies `iterator` to each item in `arr`, concatenating the results. Returns the\nconcatenated list. The `iterator`s are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of `arr` passed to the `iterator` function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, results)` which must be called once it \n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and an array of results.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the `iterator` function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n    // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as [`concat`](#concat), but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun the functions in the `tasks` array in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run, and `callback` is immediately called with the value of the error. \nOtherwise, `callback` receives an array of results when `tasks` have completed.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function, and the results will be passed to the final `callback` as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\n[`series`](#series).\n\n**Note** that while many implementations preserve the order of object properties, the\n[ECMAScript Language Specifcation](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.6) \nexplicitly states that\n\n> The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified.\n\nSo if you rely on the order in which your series of functions are executed, and want\nthis to work on all platforms, consider using an array. \n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a `callback(err, result)` it must call on completion with an error `err` (which can\n  be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the `task` callbacks.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.series([\n    function(callback){\n        // do some stuff ...\n        callback(null, \'one\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        // do some more stuff ...\n        callback(null, \'two\');\n    }\n],\n// optional callback\nfunction(err, results){\n    // results is now equal to [\'one\', \'two\']\n});\n\n\n// an example using an object instead of an array\nasync.series({\n    one: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 1);\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    two: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 2);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n},\nfunction(err, results) {\n    // results is now equal to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallel" />\n### parallel(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun the `tasks` array of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous\nfunction has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its\ncallback, the main `callback` is immediately called with the value of the error.\nOnce the `tasks` have completed, the results are passed to the final `callback` as an\narray.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function and the results will be passed to the final `callback` as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\n[`parallel`](#parallel).\n\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run. Each function is passed \n  a `callback(err, result)` which it must call on completion with an error `err` \n  (which can be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        }, 100);\n    }\n],\n// optional callback\nfunction(err, results){\n    // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n    // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n});\n\n\n// an example using an object instead of an array\nasync.parallel({\n    one: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 1);\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    two: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 2);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n},\nfunction(err, results) {\n    // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallelLimit" />\n### parallelLimit(tasks, limit, [callback])\n\nThe same as [`parallel`](#parallel), only `tasks` are executed in parallel \nwith a maximum of `limit` tasks executing at any time.\n\nNote that the `tasks` are not executed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` tasks will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed \n  a `callback(err, result)` it must call on completion with an error `err` (which can\n  be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `tasks` to run at any time.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the `task` callbacks.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call `fn`, while `test` returns `true`. Calls `callback` when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `test()` - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of `fn`.\n* `fn(callback)` - A function which is called each time `test` passes. The function is\n  passed a `callback(err)`, which must be called once it has completed with an \n  optional `err` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of `fn` has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar count = 0;\n\nasync.whilst(\n    function () { return count < 5; },\n    function (callback) {\n        count++;\n        setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n    },\n    function (err) {\n        // 5 seconds have passed\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doWhilst" />\n### doWhilst(fn, test, callback)\n\nThe post-check version of [`whilst`](#whilst). To reflect the difference in \nthe order of operations, the arguments `test` and `fn` are switched. \n\n`doWhilst` is to `whilst` as `do while` is to `while` in plain JavaScript.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call `fn` until `test` returns `true`. Calls `callback` when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of [`whilst`](#whilst).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doUntil" />\n### doUntil(fn, test, callback)\n\nLike [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst), except the `test` is inverted. Note the argument ordering differs from `until`.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forever" />\n### forever(fn, errback)\n\nCalls the asynchronous function `fn` with a callback parameter that allows it to\ncall itself again, in series, indefinitely.\n\nIf an error is passed to the callback then `errback` is called with the\nerror, and execution stops, otherwise it will never be called.\n\n```js\nasync.forever(\n    function(next) {\n        // next is suitable for passing to things that need a callback(err [, whatever]);\n        // it will result in this function being called again.\n    },\n    function(err) {\n        // if next is called with a value in its first parameter, it will appear\n        // in here as \'err\', and execution will stop.\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns the `tasks` array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the `tasks` pass an error to their own callback, the\nnext function is not executed, and the main `callback` is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a \n  `callback(err, result1, result2, ...)` it must call on completion. The first\n  argument is an error (which can be `null`) and any further arguments will be \n  passed as arguments in order to the next task.\n* `callback(err, [results])` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.waterfall([\n    function(callback){\n        callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n      // arg1 now equals \'one\' and arg2 now equals \'two\'\n        callback(null, \'three\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, callback){\n        // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n        callback(null, \'done\');\n    }\n], function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals \'done\'    \n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="compose" />\n### compose(fn1, fn2...)\n\nCreates a function which is a composition of the passed asynchronous\nfunctions. Each function consumes the return value of the function that\nfollows. Composing functions `f()`, `g()`, and `h()` would produce the result of\n`f(g(h()))`, only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values.\n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `functions...` - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nfunction add1(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n + 1);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nfunction mul3(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n * 3);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nvar add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1);\n\nadd1mul3(4, function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 15\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="seq" />\n### seq(fn1, fn2...)\n\nVersion of the compose function that is more natural to read.\nEach following function consumes the return value of the latter function. \n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* functions... - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Requires lodash (or underscore), express3 and dresende\'s orm2.\n// Part of an app, that fetches cats of the logged user.\n// This example uses `seq` function to avoid overnesting and error \n// handling clutter.\napp.get(\'/cats\', function(request, response) {\n  function handleError(err, data, callback) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err);\n      response.json({ status: \'error\', message: err.message });\n    }\n    else {\n      callback(data);\n    }\n  }\n  var User = request.models.User;\n  async.seq(\n    _.bind(User.get, User),  // \'User.get\' has signature (id, callback(err, data))\n    handleError,\n    function(user, fn) {\n      user.getCats(fn);      // \'getCats\' has signature (callback(err, data))\n    },\n    handleError,\n    function(cats) {\n      response.json({ status: \'ok\', message: \'Cats found\', data: cats });\n    }\n  )(req.session.user_id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="applyEach" />\n### applyEach(fns, args..., callback)\n\nApplies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling \n`callback` after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first\nargument, then it will return a function which lets you pass in the\narguments as if it were a single function call.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fns` - the asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments\n* `args...` - any number of separate arguments to pass to the function\n* `callback` - the final argument should be the callback, called when all\n  functions have completed processing\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], \'bucket\', callback);\n\n// partial application example:\nasync.each(\n    buckets,\n    async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]),\n    callback\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="applyEachSeries" />\n### applyEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`applyEach`](#applyEach) only the functions are applied in series.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a `queue` object with the specified `concurrency`. Tasks added to the\n`queue` are processed in parallel (up to the `concurrency` limit). If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an array of\n  `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.\n* The `unshift` method was removed.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a `cargo` object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the `payload` limit). If the\n`worker` is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once\nthe `worker` has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\nCheck out [this animation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bbd36f4cf5b35a0f11a96dcd2e97711ffc2fb37/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313637363837312f36383130382f62626330636662302d356632392d313165322d393734662d3333393763363464633835382e676966) for how `cargo` and `queue` work.\n\nWhile [queue](#queue) passes only one task to one of a group of workers\nat a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating\nwhen the worker is finished.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(tasks, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with \n  an optional `err` argument.\n* `payload` - An optional `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe `cargo` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - A function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `payload` - An `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

38845 silly resolved     readme: '# combined-stream [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixge/node-combined-stream)\n\nA stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install combined-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is a simple example that shows how you can use combined-stream to combine\ntwo files into one:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nWhile the example above works great, it will pause all source streams until\nthey are needed. If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

38845 silly resolved     readme: '# mime\n\nComprehensive MIME type mapping API. Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project, plus additional types submitted by the node.js community.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install mime\n\n## API - Queries\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\nGet the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `path` (the substring after the last \'/\' or \'.\').  E.g.\n\n    var mime = require(\'mime\');\n\n    mime.lookup(\'/path/to/file.txt\');         // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'file.txt\');                  // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'.TXT\');                      // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'htm\');                       // => \'text/html\'\n\n### mime.default_type\nSets the mime type returned when `mime.lookup` fails to find the extension searched for. (Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

It comes with useful methods for Arrays (clone, merge, applyToDefaults), Objects (removeKeys, copy), Asserting and more. \r\n\r\nFor example, to use Hoek to set configuration with default options:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Hoek = require(\'hoek\');\r\n\r\nvar default = {url : "www.github.com", port : "8000", debug : true}\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(default, {port : "3000", admin : true});\r\n\r\n// In this case, config would be { url: \'www.github.com\', port: \'3000\', debug: true, admin: true }\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder each of the sections (such as Array), there are subsections which correspond to Hoek methods. Each subsection will explain how to use the corresponding method. In each js excerpt below, the var Hoek = require(\'hoek\') is omitted for brevity.\r\n\r\n## Object\r\n\r\nHoek provides several helpful methods for objects and arrays.\r\n\r\n### clone(obj)\r\n\r\nThis method is used to clone an object or an array. A *deep copy* is made (duplicates everything, including values that are objects). \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar nestedObj = {\r\n        w: /^something$/ig,\r\n        x: {\r\n            a: [1, 2, 3],\r\n            b: 123456,\r\n            c: new Date()\r\n        },\r\n        y: \'y\',\r\n        z: new Date()\r\n    };\r\n\r\nvar copy = Hoek.clone(nestedObj);\r\n\r\ncopy.x.b = 100;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(copy.y)        // results in \'y\'\r\nconsole.log(nestedObj.x.b) // results in 123456\r\nconsole.log(copy.x.b)      // results in 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### merge(target, source, isNullOverride, isMergeArrays)\r\nisNullOverride, isMergeArrays default to true\r\n\r\nMerge all the properties of source into target, source wins in conflic, and by default null and undefined from source are applied\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar target = {a: 1, b : 2}\r\nvar source = {a: 0, c: 5}\r\nvar source2 = {a: null, c: 5}\r\n\r\nvar targetArray = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar sourceArray = [4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source);     // results in {a: 0, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2);        // results in {a: null, b: 2, c: 5}\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(target, source2, false); // results in {a: 1, b: 2, c: 5}\r\n\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray)              // results in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\nnewTarget = Hoek.merge(targetArray, sourceArray, true, false) // results in [4, 5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### applyToDefaults(defaults, options)\r\n\r\nApply options to a copy of the defaults\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar defaults = {host: "localhost", port: 8000};\r\nvar options = {port: 8080};\r\n\r\nvar config = Hoek.applyToDefaults(defaults, options); // results in {host: "localhost", port: 8080};\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### unique(array, key)\r\n\r\nRemove duplicate items from Array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.unique(array); // results in [1,2,3,4,5,6];\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\n\r\nnewArray = Hoek.unique(array, "id") // results in [{id: 1}, {id: 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### mapToObject(array, key)\r\n\r\nConvert an Array into an Object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1,2,3];\r\nvar newObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array); // results in [{"1": true}, {"2": true}, {"3": true}]\r\n\r\narray = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}];\r\nnewObject = Hoek.mapToObject(array, "id") // results in [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]\r\n\r\n```\r\n### intersect(array1, array2)\r\n\r\nFind the common unique items in two arrays\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array1 = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar array2 = [1, 4, 5];\r\n\r\nvar newArray = Hoek.intersect(array1, array2) // results in [1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### matchKeys(obj, keys) \r\n\r\nFind which keys are present\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};\r\nvar keys = ["a", "e"];\r\n\r\nHoek.matchKeys(obj, keys) // returns ["a"]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### flatten(array, target)\r\n\r\nFlatten an array\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar array = [1, 2, 3];\r\nvar target = [4, 5]; \r\n\r\nvar flattenedArray = Hoek.flatten(array, target) // results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### removeKeys(object, keys)\r\n\r\nRemove keys\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar object = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};\r\n\r\nvar keys = ["a", "b"];\r\n\r\nHoek.removeKeys(object, keys) // object is now {c: 3, d: 4}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### reach(obj, chain)\r\n\r\nConverts an object key chain string to reference\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar chain = \'a.b.c\';\r\nvar obj = {a : {b : { c : 1}}};\r\n\r\nHoek.reach(obj, chain) // returns 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### inheritAsync(self, obj, keys) \r\n\r\nInherits a selected set of methods from an object, wrapping functions in asynchronous syntax and catching errors\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar targetFunc = function () { };\r\n\r\nvar proto = {\r\n                a: function () {\r\n                    return \'a!\';\r\n                },\r\n                b: function () {\r\n                    return \'b!\';\r\n                },\r\n                c: function () {\r\n                    throw new Error(\'c!\');\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n\r\nvar keys = [\'a\', \'c\'];\r\n\r\nHoek.inheritAsync(targetFunc, proto, [\'a\', \'c\']);\r\n\r\nvar target = new targetFunc();\r\n\r\ntarget.a(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns \'a!\'       \r\n\r\ntarget.c(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // returns undefined\r\n\r\ntarget.b(function(err, result){console.log(result)}         // gives error: Object [object Object] has no method \'b\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### rename(obj, from, to)\r\n\r\nRename a key of an object\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar obj = {a : 1, b : 2};\r\n\r\nHoek.rename(obj, "a", "c");     // obj is now {c : 1, b : 2}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Timer\r\n\r\nA Timer object. Initializing a new timer object sets the ts to the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nexample : \r\n\r\n\r\nvar timerObj = new Hoek.Timer();\r\nconsole.log("Time is now: " + timerObj.ts)\r\nconsole.log("Elapsed time from initialization: " + timerObj.elapsed() + \'milliseconds\')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Binary Encoding/Decoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlEncode(value)\r\n\r\nEncodes value in Base64 or URL encoding\r\n\r\n### base64urlDecode(value)\r\n\r\nDecodes data in Base64 or URL encoding.\r\n# Escaping Characters\r\n\r\nHoek provides convenient methods for escaping html characters. The escaped characters are as followed:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\ninternals.htmlEscaped = {\r\n    \'&\': \'&amp;\',\r\n    \'<\': \'&lt;\',\r\n    \'>\': \'&gt;\',\r\n    \'"\': \'&quot;\',\r\n    "\'": \'&#x27;\',\r\n    \'`\': \'&#x60;\'\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHtml(string)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar string = \'<html> hey </html>\';\r\nvar escapedString = Hoek.escapeHtml(string); // returns &lt;html&gt; hey &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### escapeHeaderAttribute(attribute)\r\n\r\nEscape attribute value for use in HTTP header\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeHeaderAttribute(\'I said "go w\\\\o me"\');  //returns I said \\"go w\\\\o me\\"\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### escapeRegex(string)\r\n\r\nEscape string for Regex construction\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = Hoek.escapeRegex(\'4^f$s.4*5+-_?%=#!:@|~\\\\/`"(>)[<]d{}s,\');  // returns 4\\^f\\$s\\.4\\*5\\+\\-_\\?%\\=#\\!\\:@\\|~\\\\\\/`"\\(>\\)\\[<\\]d\\{\\}s\\,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Errors\r\n\r\n### assert(message)\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar a = 1, b =2;\r\n\r\nHoek.assert(a === b, \'a should equal b\');  // ABORT: a should equal b\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### abort(message)\r\n\r\nFirst checks if process.env.NODE_ENV === \'test\', and if so, throws error message. Otherwise,\r\ndisplays most recent stack and then exits process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### displayStack(slice)\r\n\r\nDisplays the trace stack\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.displayStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack) // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ \'null (/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js:4:18)\',\r\n  \'Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\',\r\n  \'Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\',\r\n  \'Module.load (module.js:356:32)\',\r\n  \'Module._load (module.js:312:12)\',\r\n  \'Module.runMain (module.js:492:10)\',\r\n  \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)\' ]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### callStack(slice)\r\n\r\nReturns a trace stack array.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar stack = Hoek.callStack();\r\nconsole.log(stack)  // returns something like:\r\n\r\n[ [ \'/Users/user/Desktop/hoek/test.js\', 4, 18, null, false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 449, 26, \'Module._compile\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 467, 10, \'Module._extensions..js\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 356, 32, \'Module.load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 312, 12, \'Module._load\', false ],\r\n  [ \'module.js\', 492, 10, \'Module.runMain\', false ],\r\n  [ \'node.js\',\r\n    244,\r\n    9,\r\n    \'startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback\',\r\n    false ] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### toss(condition)\r\n\r\ntoss(condition /*, [message], callback */)\r\n\r\nReturn an error as first argument of a callback\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load Files\r\n\r\n### loadPackage(dir)\r\n\r\nLoad and parse package.json process root or given directory\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar pack = Hoek.loadPackage();  // pack.name === \'hoek\'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### loadDirModules(path, excludeFiles, target) \r\n\r\nLoads modules from a given path; option to exclude files (array).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

38991 silly resolved     readme: '# sntp\n\nAn SNTP v4 client (RFC4330) for node. Simpy connects to the NTP or SNTP server requested and returns the server time\nalong with the roundtrip duration and clock offset. To adjust the local time to the NTP time, add the returned `t` offset\nto the local time.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hueniverse/sntp)\n\n# Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Sntp = require(\'sntp\');\n\n// All options are optional\n\nvar options = {\n    host: \'nist1-sj.ustiming.org\',  // Defaults to pool.ntp.org\n    port: 123,                      // Defaults to 123 (NTP)\n    resolveReference: true,         // Default to false (not resolving)\n    timeout: 1000                   // Defaults to zero (no timeout)\n};\n\n// Request server time\n\nSntp.time(options, function (err, time) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.log(\'Failed: \' + err.message);\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n\n    console.log(\'Local clock is off by: \' + time.t + \' milliseconds\');\n    process.exit(0);\n});\n```\n\nIf an application needs to maintain continuous time synchronization, the module provides a stateful method for\nquerying the current offset only when the last one is too old (defaults to daily).\n\n```javascript\n// Request offset once\n\nSntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n    console.log(offset);                    // New (served fresh)\n\n    // Request offset again\n\n    Sntp.offset(function (err, offset) {\n\n        console.log(offset);                // Identical (served from cache)\n    });\n});\n```\n\nTo set a background offset refresh, start the interval and use the provided now() method. If for any reason the\nclient fails to obtain an up-to-date offset, the current system clock is used.\n\n```javascript\nvar before = Sntp.now();                    // System time without offset\n\nSntp.start(function () {\n\n    var now = Sntp.now();                   // With offset\n    Sntp.stop();\n});\n```\n\n',

39304 silly resolved     readme: 'Node-CType is a way to read and write binary data in structured and easy to use\nformat. Its name comes from the C header file.\n\nTo get started, simply clone the repository or use npm to install it. Once it is\nthere, simply require it.\n\ngit clone git://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype\nnpm install ctype\nvar mod_ctype = require(\'ctype\')\n\n\nThere are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction you\'d like.\nThe low level API let\'s you read and write individual integers and floats from\nbuffers. The higher level API let\'s you read and write structures of these. To\nillustrate this, let\'s looks look at how we would read and write a binary\nencoded x,y point.\n\nIn C we would define this structure as follows:\n\ntypedef struct point {\n\tuint16_t\tp_x;\n\tuint16_t\tp_y;\n} point_t;\n\nTo read a binary encoded point from a Buffer, we first need to create a CType\nparser (where we specify the endian and other options) and add the typedef.\n\nvar parser = new mod_ctype.Parser({ endian: \'big\' });\nparser.typedef(\'point_t\', [\n\t{ x: { type: \'uint16_t\' } },\n\t{ y: { type: \'uint16_t\' } }\n]);\n\nFrom here, given a buffer buf and an offset into it, we can read a point.\n\nvar out = parser.readData([ { point: { type: \'point_t\' } } ], buffer, 0);\nconsole.log(out);\n{ point: { x: 23, y: 42 } }\n\nAnother way to get the same information would be to use the low level methods.\nNote that these require you to manually deal with the offset. Here\'s how we\'d\nget the same values of x and y from the buffer.\n\nvar x = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 0);\nvar y = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 2);\nconsole.log(x + \', \' + y);\n23, 42\n\nThe true power of this API comes from the ability to define and nest typedefs,\njust as you would in C. By default, the following types are defined by default.\nNote that they return a Number, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n    * int8_t\n    * int16_t\n    * int32_t\n    * int64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * uint8_t\n    * uint16_t\n    * uint32_t\n    * uint64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * float\n    * double\n    * char (either returns a buffer with that character or a uint8_t)\n    * char[] (returns an object with the buffer and the number of characters read which is either the total amount requested or until the first 0)\n\n\nctf2json integration:\n\nNode-CType supports consuming the output of ctf2json. Once you read in a JSON file,\nall you have to do to add all the definitions it contains is:\n\nvar data, parser;\ndata = JSON.parse(parsedJSONData);\nparser = mod_ctype.parseCTF(data, { endian: \'big\' });\n\nFor more documentation, see the file README.old. Full documentation is in the\nprocess of being rewritten as a series of manual pages which will be available\nin the repository and online for viewing.\n\nTo read the ctio manual page simple run, from the root of the workspace:\n\nman -Mman -s 3ctype ctio\n',

39304 silly resolved     readme: '# node-assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node\'s assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, \'myArg\')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require(\'assert-plus\');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, \'options\');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, \'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, \'options.isManager\');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, \'options.name\');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, \'options.email\');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, \'callback\');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren\'t* part of node\'s core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string \'name\' that\'s not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, \'foo\');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don\'t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

39339 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

39482 silly resolved     readme: '# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](http://api.nodejs.org/fs.html)\n\ngraceful-fs:\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn\'t root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require(\'graceful-fs\')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync(\'some-file-or-whatever\')\n```\n',

If `opts` is a non-object, it will be treated as\nthe `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\n`cb(err, made)` fires with the error or the first directory `made`\nthat had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdir(path, mode, cb)` and\n`opts.fs.stat(path, cb)`.\n\n## mkdirp.sync(dir, opts)\n\nSynchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at `dir`\nwith octal permission string `opts.mode`. If `opts` is a non-object, it will be\ntreated as the `opts.mode`.\n\nIf `opts.mode` isn\'t specified, it defaults to `0777 & (~process.umask())`.\n\nReturns the first directory that had to be created, if any.\n\nYou can optionally pass in an alternate `fs` implementation by passing in\n`opts.fs`. Your implementation should have `opts.fs.mkdirSync(path, mode)` and\n`opts.fs.statSync(path)`.\n\n# usage\n\nThis package also ships with a `mkdirp` command.\n\n```\nusage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] {OPTIONS}\n\n  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that\n  don\'t yet exist.\n  \n  If the directory already exists, do nothing.\n\nOPTIONS are:\n\n  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal\n               permission string.\n\n```\n\n# install\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the library, or\n\n```\nnpm install -g mkdirp\n```\n\nto get the command.\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

Scherer_ (IBM)](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-400.42/icuSources/common/punycode.c)\n* [`punycode.c` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/punycode/blob/master/punycode.c)\n* [JavaScript implementation by _some_](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183485/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-free-javascript-for-punycode-to-unicode-conversion/301287#301287)\n* [`punycode.js` by _Ben Noordhuis_](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/426298c8c1c0d5b5224ac3658c41e7c2a3fe9377/lib/punycode.js) (note: [not fully compliant](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2072))\n\nThis project is [bundled](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/punycode.js) with [Node.js v0.6.2+](https://github.com/joyent/node/compare/975f1930b1...61e796decc).\n\n## Installation\n\nVia [npm](http://npmjs.org/) (only required for Node.js releases older than v0.6.2):\n\n```bash\nnpm install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```bash\nbower install punycode\n```\n\nVia [Component](https://github.com/component/component):\n\n```bash\ncomponent install bestiejs/punycode.js\n```\n\nIn a browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="punycode.js"></script>\n```\n\nIn [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org/):\n\n```js\nvar punycode = require(\'punycode\');\n```\n\nIn [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/):\n\n```js\nload(\'punycode.js\');\n```\n\nUsing an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\n\n```js\nrequire(\n  {\n    \'paths\': {\n      \'punycode\': \'path/to/punycode\'\n    }\n  },\n  [\'punycode\'],\n  function(punycode) {\n    console.log(punycode);\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `punycode.decode(string)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string of ASCII symbols to a string of Unicode symbols.\n\n```js\n// decode domain name parts\npunycode.decode(\'maana-pta\'); // \'mañana\'\npunycode.decode(\'--dqo34k\'); // \'☃-⌘\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.encode(string)`\n\nConverts a string of Unicode symbols to a Punycode string of ASCII symbols.\n\n```js\n// encode domain name parts\npunycode.encode(\'mañana\'); // \'maana-pta\'\npunycode.encode(\'☃-⌘\'); // \'--dqo34k\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toUnicode(input)`\n\nConverts a Punycode string representing a domain name or an email address to Unicode. Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.\n\n```js\n// decode domain names\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn--maana-pta.com\');\n// → \'mañana.com\'\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn----dqo34k.com\');\n// → \'☃-⌘.com\'\n\n// decode email addresses\npunycode.toUnicode(\'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\');\n// → \'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toASCII(input)`\n\nConverts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that\'s already in ASCII.\n\n```js\n// encode domain names\npunycode.toASCII(\'mañana.com\');\n// → \'xn--maana-pta.com\'\npunycode.toASCII(\'☃-⌘.com\');\n// → \'xn----dqo34k.com\'\n\n// encode email addresses\npunycode.toASCII(\'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\');\n// → \'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.ucs2`\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`\n\nCreates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'abc\');\n// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]\n// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'\\uD834\\uDF06\');\n// → [0x1D306]\n```\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`\n\nCreates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);\n// → \'abc\'\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);\n// → \'\\uD834\\uDF06\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.version`\n\nA string representing the current Punycode.js version number.\n\n## Unit tests & code coverage\n\nAfter cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.\n\nOnce that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.\n\nTo generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n## Author\n\n| [![twitter/mathias](https://gravatar.com/avatar/24e08a9ea84deb17ae121074d0f17125?s=70)](https://twitter.com/mathias "Follow @mathias on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/) |\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [![twitter/jdalton](https://gravatar.com/avatar/299a3d891ff1920b69c364d061007043?s=70)](https://twitter.com/jdalton "Follow @jdalton on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) |\n\n## License\n\nPunycode.js is available under the [MIT](http://mths.be/mit) license.\n',

39992 silly resolved     readme: 'Like FS streams, but with stat on them, and supporting directories and\nsymbolic links, as well as normal files.  Also, you can use this to set\nthe stats on a file, even if you don\'t change its contents, or to create\na symlink, etc.\n\nSo, for example, you can "write" a directory, and it\'ll call `mkdir`.  You\ncan specify a uid and gid, and it\'ll call `chown`.  You can specify a\n`mtime` and `atime`, and it\'ll call `utimes`.  You can call it a symlink\nand provide a `linkpath` and it\'ll call `symlink`.\n\nNote that it won\'t automatically resolve symbolic links.  So, if you\ncall `fstream.Reader(\'/some/symlink\')` then you\'ll get an object\nthat stats and then ends immediately (since it has no data).  To follow\nsymbolic links, do this: `fstream.Reader({path:\'/some/symlink\', follow:\ntrue })`.\n\nThere are various checks to make sure that the bytes emitted are the\nsame as the intended size, if the size is set.\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nThis will create the directories if they\'re missing, and then write\n`hello\\n` into the file, chmod it to 0755, and assert that 6 bytes have\nbeen written when it\'s done.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/file"\n          , mode: 0755\n          , size: 6\n          , flags: "a"\n          })\n  .write("hello\\n")\n  .end()\n```\n\nYou can pass flags in, if you want to append to a file.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Writer({ path: "path/to/symlink"\n          , linkpath: "./file"\n          , SymbolicLink: true\n          , mode: "0755" // octal strings supported\n          })\n  .end()\n```\n\nIf isSymbolicLink is a function, it\'ll be called, and if it returns\ntrue, then it\'ll treat it as a symlink.  If it\'s not a function, then\nany truish value will make a symlink, or you can set `type:\n\'SymbolicLink\'`, which does the same thing.\n\nNote that the linkpath is relative to the symbolic link location, not\nthe parent dir or cwd.\n\n```javascript\nfstream\n  .Reader("path/to/dir")\n  .pipe(fstream.Writer("path/to/other/dir"))\n```\n\nThis will do like `cp -Rp path/to/dir path/to/other/dir`.  If the other\ndir exists and isn\'t a directory, then it\'ll emit an error.  It\'ll also\nset the uid, gid, mode, etc. to be identical.  In this way, it\'s more\nlike `rsync -a` than simply a copy.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\nincluded in its place.\n\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\n\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\n\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\n  to send an authenticated request), and\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\n\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\n\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\nand the server.\n\n\n## Replay Protection\n\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\nkey identifier combination. \n\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\n\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\nto a bad timestamp.\n\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\n\n\n## Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\n        user: \'Steve\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    // Authenticate incoming request\n\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\n\n        // Prepare response\n\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\n\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\n\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\n\n        // Send the response back\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\n        res.end(payload);\n    });\n};\n\n// Start server\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nClient code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Request options\n\nvar requestOptions = {\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {}\n};\n\n// Generate Authorization request header\n\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\n\n// Send authenticated request\n\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\n\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\n\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\n\n    // Output results\n\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\n});\n```\n\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\n\n```javascript\nHawk.sntp.start();\n```\n\n\n## Protocol Example\n\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\nthe resource server:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\n```\n\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\n```\n\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\n\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\n* Algorithm: sha256\n\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\ncharacter):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nGET\n/resource/1?b=1&a=2\nexample.com\n8000\n\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\n\n```\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\n```\n\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\n```\n\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\n\n\n### Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\n* `hawk.1.payload`\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\n\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.payload\ntext/plain\nThank you for flying Hawk\n\n```\n\nWhich produces the following hash value:\n\n```\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\n```\n\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nPOST\n/resource/1?a=1&b=2\nexample.com\n8000\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nPOST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\n```\n\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\nand the nature of the data included.\n\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\n\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\n\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\n\n\n## Response Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\n\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\n\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\n\n```\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js).\n\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\n\n\n# Single URI Authorization\n\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\n\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\n\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\nthe granted access timeframe. \n\n\n## Bewit Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\n    });\n};\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nBewit code generation:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Generate bewit\n\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\n```\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\n\n### MAC Keys Transmission\n\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\n\n### Confidentiality of Requests\n\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\nto protect sensitive resources.\n\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\n\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\n\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\n\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\n\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\n\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\naccess.\n\n### Entropy of Keys\n\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\ncredentials are valid.\n\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\nlongest key reasonable.\n\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\n\n### Coverage Limitations\n\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\n\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\n\n### Future Time Manipulation\n\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\n\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\n\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\n\n### Client Clock Poisoning\n\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\nthat particular server.\n\n### Bewit Limitations\n\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\nand sensitive information.\n\n### Host Header Forgery\n\nHawk validates the incoming request MAC against the incoming HTTP Host header. However, unless the optional `host` and `port`\noptions are used with `server.authenticate()`, a malicous client can mint new host names pointing to the server\'s IP address and\nuse that to craft an attack by sending a valid request that\'s meant for another hostname than the one used by the server. Server\nimplementors must manually verify that the host header received matches their expectation (or use the options mentioned above).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Where is the protocol specification?\n\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\nsomething? Open an issue!\n\n### Is it done?\n\nAt if version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\nand suggestions.\n\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\n\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, it has been ported to other languages.\nThe full list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port&state=closed). Please add an issue if you are\nworking on another port. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\n\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\n\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\n\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\n\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\n\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\n\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\n\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\n\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\n\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\n\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\n\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\n\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\n\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against expliots created after a potential change in how the protocol\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\n\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\nat work to produce more garbage.\n\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\n\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\n\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\n',

40633 silly resolved     readme: '# bl *(BufferList)*\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/bl)\n\n**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/bl.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n\n**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!\n\nThe original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(\'hi\')                     // bl will also accept & convert Strings\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer([ 0x3, 0x4 ]))\n\nconsole.log(bl.length) // 12\n\nconsole.log(bl.slice(0, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'abcdefghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'defghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 6).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'def\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 8).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(5, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'fghij\'\n\n// or just use toString!\nconsole.log(bl.toString())               // \'abcdefghij\\u0003\\u0004\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 3, 8))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 5, 10)) // \'fghij\'\n\n// other standard Buffer readables\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16BE(10)) // 0x0304\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16LE(10)) // 0x0403\n```\n\nGive it a callback in the constructor and use it just like **[concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)**:\n\n```js\nconst bl = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs = require(\'fs\')\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'README.md\')\n  .pipe(bl(function (err, data) { // note \'new\' isn\'t strictly required\n    // `data` is a complete Buffer object containing the full data\n    console.log(data.toString())\n  }))\n```\n\nNote that when you use the *callback* method like this, the resulting `data` parameter is a concatenation of all `Buffer` objects in the list. If you want to avoid the overhead of this concatenation (in cases of extreme performance consciousness), then avoid the *callback* method and just listen to `\'end\'` instead, like a standard Stream.\n\nOr to fetch a URL using [hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest) (should work with [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) and even plain Node http too!):\n```js\nconst hyperquest = require(\'hyperquest\')\n    , bl         = require(\'bl\')\n    , url        = \'https://raw.github.com/rvagg/bl/master/README.md\'\n\nhyperquest(url).pipe(bl(function (err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString())\n}))\n```\n\nOr, use it as a readable stream to recompose a list of Buffers to an output source:\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs         = require(\'fs\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'hi\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\n\nbl.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'gibberish.txt\'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n  * <a href="#ctor"><code><b>new BufferList([ callback ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#length"><code>bl.<b>length</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#append"><code>bl.<b>append(buffer)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#get"><code>bl.<b>get(index)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#slice"><code>bl.<b>slice([ start[, end ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#copy"><code>bl.<b>copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#duplicate"><code>bl.<b>duplicate()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#consume"><code>bl.<b>consume(bytes)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#toString"><code>bl.<b>toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#readXX"><code>bl.<b>readDoubleBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readDoubleLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt8()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt8()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#streams">Streams</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="ctor"></a>\n### new BufferList([ callback | buffer | buffer array ])\nThe constructor takes an optional callback, if supplied, the callback will be called with an error argument followed by a reference to the **bl** instance, when `bl.end()` is called (i.e. from a piped stream). This is a convenient method of collecting the entire contents of a stream, particularly when the stream is *chunky*, such as a network stream.\n\nNormally, no arguments are required for the constructor, but you can initialise the list by passing in a single `Buffer` object or an array of `Buffer` object.\n\n`new` is not strictly required, if you don\'t instantiate a new object, it will be done automatically for you so you can create a new instance simply with:\n\n```js\nvar bl = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = bl()\n\n// equivilant to:\n\nvar BufferList = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = new BufferList()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="length"></a>\n### bl.length\nGet the length of the list in bytes. This is the sum of the lengths of all of the buffers contained in the list, minus any initial offset for a semi-consumed buffer at the beginning. Should accurately represent the total number of bytes that can be read from the list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="append"></a>\n### bl.append(buffer)\n`append(buffer)` adds an additional buffer or BufferList to the internal list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="get"></a>\n### bl.get(index)\n`get()` will return the byte at the specified index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="slice"></a>\n### bl.slice([ start, [ end ] ])\n`slice()` returns a new `Buffer` object containing the bytes within the range specified. Both `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\nIf the requested range spans a single internal buffer then a slice of that buffer will be returned which shares the original memory range of that Buffer. If the range spans multiple buffers then copy operations will likely occur to give you a uniform Buffer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="copy"></a>\n### bl.copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])\n`copy()` copies the content of the list in the `dest` buffer, starting from `destStart` and containing the bytes within the range specified with `srcStart` to `srcEnd`. `destStart`, `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning of the `dest` buffer, and the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="duplicate"></a>\n### bl.duplicate()\n`duplicate()` performs a **shallow-copy** of the list. The internal Buffers remains the same, so if you change the underlying Buffers, the change will be reflected in both the original and the duplicate. This method is needed if you want to call `consume()` or `pipe()` and still keep the original list.Example:\n\n```js\nvar bl = new BufferList()\n\nbl.append(\'hello\')\nbl.append(\' world\')\nbl.append(\'\\n\')\n\nbl.duplicate().pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })\n\nconsole.log(bl.toString())\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="consume"></a>\n### bl.consume(bytes)\n`consume()` will shift bytes *off the start of the list*. The number of bytes consumed don\'t need to line up with the sizes of the internal Buffers&mdash;initial offsets will be calculated accordingly in order to give you a consistent view of the data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="toString"></a>\n### bl.toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])\n`toString()` will return a string representation of the buffer. The optional `start` and `end` arguments are passed on to `slice()`, while the `encoding` is passed on to `toString()` of the resulting Buffer. See the [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end) documentation for more information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="readXX"></a>\n### <code>bl.readDoubleBE()</code>, <code>bl.readDoubleLE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatBE()</code>, <code>bl.readFloatLE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt32LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16BE()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt16LE()</code>, <code>bl.readInt8()</code>, <code>bl.readUInt8()</code>\n\nAll of the standard byte-reading methods of the `Buffer` interface are implemented and will operate across internal Buffer boundaries transparently.\n\nSee the <b><code>[Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html)</code></b> documentation for how these work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="streams"></a>\n### Streams\n**bl** is a Node **[Duplex Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)**, so it can be read from and written to like a standard Node stream.

40633 silly resolved     readme: '# qs\n\nA querystring parsing and stringifying library with some added security.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs)\n\nLead Maintainer: [Nathan LaFreniere](https://github.com/nlf)\n\nThe **qs** module was originally created and maintained by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring).\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Qs = require(\'qs\');\n\nvar obj = Qs.parse(\'a=c\');    // { a: \'c\' }\nvar str = Qs.stringify(obj);  // \'a=c\'\n```\n\n### Parsing Objects\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(string, [depth], [delimiter]);\n```\n\n**qs** allows you to create nested objects within your query strings, by surrounding the name of sub-keys with square brackets `[]`.\nFor example, the string `\'foo[bar]=baz\'` converts to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: \'baz\'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nURI encoded strings work too:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a%5Bb%5D=c\');\n// { a: { b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also nest your objects, like `\'foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz\'`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: {\n      baz: \'foobarbaz\'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, when nesting objects **qs** will only parse up to 5 children deep. This means if you attempt to parse a string like\n`\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\'` your resulting object will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  a: {\n    b: {\n      c: {\n        d: {\n          e: {\n            f: {\n              \'[g][h][i]\': \'j\'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `Qs.parse(string, depth)`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\', 1);\n// { a: { b: { \'[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]\': \'j\' } } }\n```\n\nThe depth limit mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number.\n\nAn optional delimiter can also be passed:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d\', \';\');\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }\n```\n\n### Parsing Arrays\n\n**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=b&a[]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nYou may specify an index as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=c&a[0]=b\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number\nto create an array. When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving\ntheir order:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b&a[15]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=&a[]=b\');\n// { a: [\'\', \'b\'] }\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[1]=&a[2]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\n**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`. Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will\ninstead be converted to an object with the index as the key:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[100]=b\');\n// { a: { \'100\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nIf you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[b]=c\');\n// { a: { \'0\': \'b\', b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also create arrays of objects:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[][b]=c\');\n// { a: [{ b: \'c\' }] }\n```\n\n### Stringifying\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify(object, [delimiter]);\n```\n\nWhen stringifying, **qs** always URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\' });\n// \'a=b\'\nQs.stringify({ a: { b: \'c\' } });\n// \'a%5Bb%5D=c\'\n```\n\nExamples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity. Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.\n\nWhen arrays are stringified, they are always given explicit indices:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] });\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c&a[2]=d\'\n```\n\nEmpty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'\' });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nProperties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nThe delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }, \';\');\n// \'a=b;c=d\'\n```\n',

Feel free to add more!\n- Browser support via Browserify and Component by converting lists to JSON files.\n\nOtherwise, the API is compatible.\n\n### Adding Types\n\nIf you\'d like to add additional types,\nsimply create a PR adding the type to `custom.json` and\na reference link to the [sources](SOURCES.md).\n\nDo __NOT__ edit `mime.json` or `node.json`.\nThose are pulled using `build.js`.\nYou should only touch `custom.json`.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar mime = require(\'mime-types\')\n```\n\nAll functions return `false` if input is invalid or not found.\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\n\nLookup the content-type associated with a file.\n\n```js\nmime.lookup(\'json\')           // \'application/json\'\nmime.lookup(\'.md\')            // \'text/x-markdown\'\nmime.lookup(\'file.html\')      // \'text/html\'\nmime.lookup(\'folder/file.js\') // \'application/javascript\'\n\nmime.lookup(\'cats\') // false\n```\n\n### mime.contentType(type)\n\nCreate a full content-type header given a content-type or extension.\n\n```js\nmime.contentType(\'markdown\')  // \'text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8\'\nmime.contentType(\'file.json\') // \'application/json; charset=utf-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.extension(type)\n\nGet the default extension for a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\') // \'bin\'\n```\n\n### mime.charset(type)\n\nLookup the implied default charset of a content-type.\n\n```js\nmime.charset(\'text/x-markdown\') // \'UTF-8\'\n```\n\n### mime.types[extension] = type\n\nA map of content-types by extension.\n\n### mime.extensions[type] = [extensions]\n\nA map of extensions by content-type.\n\n### mime.define(types)\n\nGlobally add definitions.\n`types` must be an object of the form:\n\n```js\n{\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...],\n  "<content-type>": [extensions...]\n}\n```\n\nSee the `.json` files in `lib/` for examples.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n',

40633 silly resolved     readme: '# node-uuid\n\nSimple, fast generation of [RFC4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDS.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Generate RFC4122 version 1 or version 4 UUIDs\n* Runs in node.js and all browsers.\n* Registered as a [ComponentJS](https://github.com/component/component) [component](https://github.com/component/component/wiki/Components) (\'broofa/node-uuid\').\n* Cryptographically strong random # generation on supporting platforms\n* 1.1K minified and gzip\'ed  (Want something smaller?  Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )\n* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall it in your browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="uuid.js"></script>\n```\n\nOr in node.js:\n\n```\nnpm install node-uuid\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar uuid = require(\'node-uuid\');\n```\n\nThen create some ids ...\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a v1 (time-based) id\nuuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n\n// Generate a v4 (random) id\nuuid.v4(); // -> \'110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1\'\n```\n\n## API\n\n### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The randomly generated node id is only guaranteed to stay constant for the lifetime of the current JS runtime. (Future versions of this module may use persistent storage mechanisms to extend this guarantee.)\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v1({\n  node: [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab],\n  clockseq: 0x1234,\n  msecs: new Date(\'2011-11-01\').getTime(),\n  nsecs: 5678\n});   // -> "710b962e-041c-11e1-9234-0123456789ab"\n```\n\nExample: In-place generation of two binary IDs\n\n```javascript\n// Generate two ids in an array\nvar arr = new Array(32); // -> []\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 0);   // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 16);  // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15 02 a3 1c b0 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\n\n// Optionally use uuid.unparse() to get stringify the ids\nuuid.unparse(buffer);    // -> \'02a2ce90-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\nuuid.unparse(buffer, 16) // -> \'02a31cb0-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\n```\n\n### uuid.v4([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v4 UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\n> cd test\n> node test.js\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the [XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n[streams2-thing]: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_versions\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, call ```submit(url, [callback])``` method:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'http://example.org/\', function(err, res) {\n  // res – response object (http.IncomingMessage)  //\n  res.resume(); // for node-0.10.x\n});\n\n```\n\nFor more advanced request manipulations ```submit()``` method returns ```http.ClientRequest``` object, or you can choose from one of the alternative submission methods.\n\n### Alternative submission methods\n\nYou can use node\'s http client interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (```fs.readStream```, ```http.response``` and ```mikeal\'s request```), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nIn case you need to also send custom HTTP headers with the POST request, you can use the `headers` key in first parameter of `form.submit()`:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/surelynot.php\',\n  headers: {\'x-test-header\': \'test-header-value\'}\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- ```getLengthSync()``` method DOESN\'T calculate length for streams, use ```knownLength``` options as workaround.\n- If it feels like FormData hangs after submit and you\'re on ```node-0.10```, please check [Compatibility with Older Node Versions][streams2-thing]\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

40927 silly resolved     readme: 'JSHint, A Static Code Analysis Tool for JavaScript\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[ [Use it online](http://jshint.com/) •  [About](http://jshint.com/about/) • \n[Docs](http://jshint.com/docs/) • [FAQ](http://jshint.com/docs/faq) • \n[Install](http://jshint.com/install/) • [Hack](http://jshint.com/hack/) • \n[Blog](http://jshint.com/blog/) • [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jshint/) \\]\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshint/jshint)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jshint.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/jshint)\n\nJSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems\nin JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions. It is\nvery flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines\nand the environment you expect your code to execute in.\n\n#### JSHint 2.x versus JSHint 3\n\nThere\'s an effort going on to release the next major version of JSHint. All\ndevelopment in the `master` branch is for the version 3.0. Current stable\nversion is in the `2.x` branch. Keep that in mind when submitting pull requests.\n\nAlso, before reporting a bug or thinking about hacking on JSHint, read this:\n[JSHint 3 plans](http://www.jshint.com/blog/jshint-3-plans/). TL;DR: we\'re\nmoving away from style checks within JSHint so no new features around\nstyle checks will be accepted. Bug fixes are fine for the `2.x` branch.\n\n#### Reporting a bug\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn\'t work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n\n#### License\n\nJSHint is distributed under the MIT License. One file and one file only\n(src/stable/jshint.js) is distributed under the slightly modified MIT License.\n\n\n#### Thank you!\n\nWe really appreciate all kind of feedback and contributions. Thanks for using and supporting JSHint!\n',

41100 silly resolved     readme: '# amdefine\n\nA module that can be used to implement AMD\'s define() in Node. This allows you\nto code to the AMD API and have the module work in node programs without\nrequiring those other programs to use AMD.\n\n## Usage\n\n**1)** Update your package.json to indicate amdefine as a dependency:\n\n```javascript\n    "dependencies": {\n        "amdefine": ">=0.1.0"\n    }\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` to get amdefine into your project.\n\n**2)** At the top of each module that uses define(), place this code:\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module) }\n```\n\n**Only use these snippets** when loading amdefine. If you preserve the basic structure,\nwith the braces, it will be stripped out when using the [RequireJS optimizer](#optimizer).\n\nYou can add spaces, line breaks and even require amdefine with a local path, but\nkeep the rest of the structure to get the stripping behavior.\n\nAs you may know, because `if` statements in JavaScript don\'t have their own scope, the var\ndeclaration in the above snippet is made whether the `if` expression is truthy or not. If\nRequireJS is loaded then the declaration is superfluous because `define` is already already\ndeclared in the same scope in RequireJS. Fortunately JavaScript handles multiple `var`\ndeclarations of the same variable in the same scope gracefully.\n\nIf you want to deliver amdefine.js with your code rather than specifying it as a dependency\nwith npm, then just download the latest release and refer to it using a relative path:\n\n[Latest Version](https://github.com/jrburke/amdefine/raw/latest/amdefine.js)\n\n### amdefine/intercept\n\nConsider this very experimental.\n\nInstead of pasting the piece of text for the amdefine setup of a `define`\nvariable in each module you create or consume, you can use `amdefine/intercept`\ninstead. It will automatically insert the above snippet in each .js file loaded\nby Node.\n\n**Warning**: you should only use this if you are creating an application that\nis consuming AMD style defined()\'d modules that are distributed via npm and want\nto run that code in Node.\n\nFor library code where you are not sure if it will be used by others in Node or\nin the browser, then explicitly depending on amdefine and placing the code\nsnippet above is suggested path, instead of using `amdefine/intercept`. The\nintercept module affects all .js files loaded in the Node app, and it is\ninconsiderate to modify global state like that unless you are also controlling\nthe top level app.\n\n#### Why distribute AMD-style nodes via npm?\n\nnpm has a lot of weaknesses for front-end use (installed layout is not great,\nshould have better support for the `baseUrl + moduleID + \'.js\' style of loading,\nsingle file JS installs), but some people want a JS package manager and are\nwilling to live with those constraints. If that is you, but still want to author\nin AMD style modules to get dynamic require([]), better direct source usage and\npowerful loader plugin support in the browser, then this tool can help.\n\n#### amdefine/intercept usage\n\nJust require it in your top level app module (for example index.js, server.js):\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\'amdefine/intercept\');\n```\n\nThe module does not return a value, so no need to assign the result to a local\nvariable.\n\nThen just require() code as you normally would with Node\'s require(). Any .js\nloaded after the intercept require will have the amdefine check injected in\nthe .js source as it is loaded. It does not modify the source on disk, just\nprepends some content to the text of the module as it is loaded by Node.\n\n#### How amdefine/intercept works\n\nIt overrides the `Module._extensions[\'.js\']` in Node to automatically prepend\nthe amdefine snippet above. So, it will affect any .js file loaded by your\napp.\n\n## define() usage\n\nIt is best if you use the anonymous forms of define() in your module:\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    var dependency = require(\'dependency\');\n});\n```\n\nor\n\n```javascript\ndefine([\'dependency\'], function (dependency) {\n\n});\n```\n\n## RequireJS optimizer integration. <a name="optimizer"></name>\n\nVersion 1.0.3 of the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)\nwill have support for stripping the `if (typeof define !== \'function\')` check\nmentioned above, so you can include this snippet for code that runs in the\nbrowser, but avoid taking the cost of the if() statement once the code is\noptimized for deployment.\n\n## Node 0.4 Support\n\nIf you want to support Node 0.4, then add `require` as the second parameter to amdefine:\n\n```javascript\n//Only if you want Node 0.4. If using 0.5 or later, use the above snippet.\nif (typeof define !== \'function\') { var define = require(\'amdefine\')(module, require) }\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\n\namdefine creates a define() function that is callable by your code. It will\nexecute and trace dependencies and call the factory function *synchronously*,\nto keep the behavior in line with Node\'s synchronous dependency tracing.\n\nThe exception: calling AMD\'s callback-style require() from inside a factory\nfunction. The require callback is called on process.nextTick():\n\n```javascript\ndefine(function (require) {\n    require([\'a\'], function(a) {\n        //\'a\' is loaded synchronously, but\n        //this callback is called on process.nextTick().\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Loader Plugins\n\nLoader plugins are supported as long as they call their load() callbacks\nsynchronously. So ones that do network requests will not work. However plugins\nlike [text](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text) can load text files locally.\n\nThe plugin API\'s `load.fromText()` is **not supported** in amdefine, so this means\ntranspiler plugins like the [CoffeeScript loader plugin](https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs)\nwill not work. This may be fixable, but it is a bit complex, and I do not have\nenough node-fu to figure it out yet. See the source for amdefine.js if you want\nto get an idea of the issues involved.\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the tests, cd to **tests** and run:\n\n```\nnode all.js\nnode all-intercept.js\n```\n\n## License\n\nNew BSD and MIT. Check the LICENSE file for all the details.\n',

Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project, plus additional types submitted by the node.js community.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    npm install mime\n\n## API - Queries\n\n### mime.lookup(path)\nGet the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `path` (the substring after the last \'/\' or \'.\').  E.g.\n\n    var mime = require(\'mime\');\n\n    mime.lookup(\'/path/to/file.txt\');         // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'file.txt\');                  // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'.TXT\');                      // => \'text/plain\'\n    mime.lookup(\'htm\');                       // => \'text/html\'\n\n### mime.default_type\nSets the mime type returned when `mime.lookup` fails to find the extension searched for. (Default is `application/octet-stream`.)\n\n### mime.extension(type)\nGet the default extension for `type`\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/html\');                 // => \'html\'\n    mime.extension(\'application/octet-stream\');  // => \'bin\'\n\n### mime.charsets.lookup()\n\nMap mime-type to charset\n\n    mime.charsets.lookup(\'text/plain\');        // => \'UTF-8\'\n\n(The logic for charset lookups is pretty rudimentary.  Feel free to suggest improvements.)\n\n## API - Defining Custom Types\n\nThe following APIs allow you to add your own type mappings within your project.  If you feel a type should be included as part of node-mime, see [requesting new types](https://github.com/broofa/node-mime/wiki/Requesting-New-Types).\n\n### mime.define()\n\nAdd custom mime/extension mappings\n\n    mime.define({\n        \'text/x-some-format\': [\'x-sf\', \'x-sft\', \'x-sfml\'],\n        \'application/x-my-type\': [\'x-mt\', \'x-mtt\'],\n        // etc ...\n    });\n\n    mime.lookup(\'x-sft\');                 // => \'text/x-some-format\'\n\nThe first entry in the extensions array is returned by `mime.extension()`. E.g.\n\n    mime.extension(\'text/x-some-format\'); // => \'x-sf\'\n\n### mime.load(filepath)\n\nLoad mappings from an Apache ".types" format file\n\n    mime.load(\'./my_project.types\');\n\nThe .types file format is simple -  See the `types` dir for examples.\n',

If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

41385 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed.

Composing functions `f()`, `g()`, and `h()` would produce the result of\n`f(g(h()))`, only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values.\n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `functions...` - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nfunction add1(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n + 1);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nfunction mul3(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n * 3);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nvar add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1);\n\nadd1mul3(4, function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 15\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="seq" />\n### seq(fn1, fn2...)\n\nVersion of the compose function that is more natural to read.\nEach following function consumes the return value of the latter function. \n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* functions... - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Requires lodash (or underscore), express3 and dresende\'s orm2.\n// Part of an app, that fetches cats of the logged user.\n// This example uses `seq` function to avoid overnesting and error \n// handling clutter.\napp.get(\'/cats\', function(request, response) {\n  function handleError(err, data, callback) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err);\n      response.json({ status: \'error\', message: err.message });\n    }\n    else {\n      callback(data);\n    }\n  }\n  var User = request.models.User;\n  async.seq(\n    _.bind(User.get, User),  // \'User.get\' has signature (id, callback(err, data))\n    handleError,\n    function(user, fn) {\n      user.getCats(fn);      // \'getCats\' has signature (callback(err, data))\n    },\n    handleError,\n    function(cats) {\n      response.json({ status: \'ok\', message: \'Cats found\', data: cats });\n    }\n  )(req.session.user_id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="applyEach" />\n### applyEach(fns, args..., callback)\n\nApplies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling \n`callback` after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first\nargument, then it will return a function which lets you pass in the\narguments as if it were a single function call.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fns` - the asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments\n* `args...` - any number of separate arguments to pass to the function\n* `callback` - the final argument should be the callback, called when all\n  functions have completed processing\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], \'bucket\', callback);\n\n// partial application example:\nasync.each(\n    buckets,\n    async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]),\n    callback\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="applyEachSeries" />\n### applyEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`applyEach`](#applyEach) only the functions are applied in series.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a `queue` object with the specified `concurrency`. Tasks added to the\n`queue` are processed in parallel (up to the `concurrency` limit). If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an array of\n  `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.\n* The `unshift` method was removed.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a `cargo` object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the `payload` limit). If the\n`worker` is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once\nthe `worker` has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\nCheck out [this animation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bbd36f4cf5b35a0f11a96dcd2e97711ffc2fb37/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313637363837312f36383130382f62626330636662302d356632392d313165322d393734662d3333393763363464633835382e676966) for how `cargo` and `queue` work.\n\nWhile [queue](#queue) passes only one task to one of a group of workers\nat a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating\nwhen the worker is finished.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(tasks, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with \n  an optional `err` argument.\n* `payload` - An optional `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe `cargo` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - A function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `payload` - An `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

Its name comes from the C header file.\n\nTo get started, simply clone the repository or use npm to install it. Once it is\nthere, simply require it.\n\ngit clone git://github.com/rmustacc/node-ctype\nnpm install ctype\nvar mod_ctype = require(\'ctype\')\n\n\nThere are two APIs that you can use, depending on what abstraction you\'d like.\nThe low level API let\'s you read and write individual integers and floats from\nbuffers. The higher level API let\'s you read and write structures of these. To\nillustrate this, let\'s looks look at how we would read and write a binary\nencoded x,y point.\n\nIn C we would define this structure as follows:\n\ntypedef struct point {\n\tuint16_t\tp_x;\n\tuint16_t\tp_y;\n} point_t;\n\nTo read a binary encoded point from a Buffer, we first need to create a CType\nparser (where we specify the endian and other options) and add the typedef.\n\nvar parser = new mod_ctype.Parser({ endian: \'big\' });\nparser.typedef(\'point_t\', [\n\t{ x: { type: \'uint16_t\' } },\n\t{ y: { type: \'uint16_t\' } }\n]);\n\nFrom here, given a buffer buf and an offset into it, we can read a point.\n\nvar out = parser.readData([ { point: { type: \'point_t\' } } ], buffer, 0);\nconsole.log(out);\n{ point: { x: 23, y: 42 } }\n\nAnother way to get the same information would be to use the low level methods.\nNote that these require you to manually deal with the offset. Here\'s how we\'d\nget the same values of x and y from the buffer.\n\nvar x = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 0);\nvar y = mod_ctype.ruint16(buf, \'big\', 2);\nconsole.log(x + \', \' + y);\n23, 42\n\nThe true power of this API comes from the ability to define and nest typedefs,\njust as you would in C. By default, the following types are defined by default.\nNote that they return a Number, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n    * int8_t\n    * int16_t\n    * int32_t\n    * int64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * uint8_t\n    * uint16_t\n    * uint32_t\n    * uint64_t (returns an array where val[0] << 32 + val[1] would be the value)\n    * float\n    * double\n    * char (either returns a buffer with that character or a uint8_t)\n    * char[] (returns an object with the buffer and the number of characters read which is either the total amount requested or until the first 0)\n\n\nctf2json integration:\n\nNode-CType supports consuming the output of ctf2json. Once you read in a JSON file,\nall you have to do to add all the definitions it contains is:\n\nvar data, parser;\ndata = JSON.parse(parsedJSONData);\nparser = mod_ctype.parseCTF(data, { endian: \'big\' });\n\nFor more documentation, see the file README.old. Full documentation is in the\nprocess of being rewritten as a series of manual pages which will be available\nin the repository and online for viewing.\n\nTo read the ctio manual page simple run, from the root of the workspace:\n\nman -Mman -s 3ctype ctio\n',

41767 silly resolved     readme: '# node-assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node\'s assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, \'myArg\')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n    var assert = require(\'assert-plus\');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n\t    assert.object(options, \'options\');\n\t\tassert.number(options.id, \'options.id);\n\t\tassert.bool(options.isManager, \'options.isManager\');\n\t\tassert.string(options.name, \'options.name\');\n\t\tassert.arrayOfString(options.email, \'options.email\');\n\t\tassert.func(callback, \'callback\');\n\n        // Do stuff\n\t\tcallback(null, {});\n    }\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren\'t* part of node\'s core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string \'name\' that\'s not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n\tat test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n\tat Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n\tat Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n\tat Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n\tat Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n\tat Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n\tat Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n\tat EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.string(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogenous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n    function test(foo) {\n\t    assert.arrayOfString(foo, \'foo\');\n    }\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n    assert.optionalString(foo, \'foo\');\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don\'t want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

41809 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',
